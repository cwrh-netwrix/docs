See the [Single Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md) topic for additional information. _Remember,_ the states `21` and `22` are both displayed in the UI as **Suggested** but they do not mean the exact same thing. `23` - **Automatic but with Validation**: the assignment comes from a rule of type `Automatic but with Validation` and appears in a new user's permission basket. See the [Single Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md) topic for additional information. `24` - **Approved - Questioned**: the assignment was approved manually, then a change has been made in the assignment's source data via one of Identity Manager's workflows that should change the assignment but the manual approval is authoritative. See the [Resource Type](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.md) topic for additional information. ![Workflow State: Approved - Questioned](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/automationrule/24_approvedquestioned_v603.webp) `25` - **Pending Approval - Risk**: the assignment must be reviewed due to a risk. ![Workflow State: Pending Approval (Risk)](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/automationrule/25_pendingapprovalrisk_v603.webp) `26` - **Blocked**: the assignment is blocked due to a risk of type `Blocking`. Does not appear in the UI. `27` - **Prolonged**: the assignment has expired but it was set with a grace period. See the [Single Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md) topic for additional information. ![Workflow State: Prolonged](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/automationrule/27_prolonged_v603.webp) `116` - **Approved - Risk**: the assignment is approved despite a risk. ![Workflow State: Approved (Risk)](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/16_approved_v603.webp) `118` - **Given by a Role**: the assignment comes from the assignment of a role. For example, when a user is assigned a SAP entitlement without having a SAP account, the account is created automatically with this state. ![Workflow State: Given by a Role](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/automationrule/118_givenbyarole_v603.webp) **Found** - Will match assignments not supported by a rule. ![Workflow State: Non-conforming](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/1_nonconforming_v603.webp) **Historic** - Will match assignments not supported by a rule, which existed before the production launch. ![Workflow State: Pre-existing](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/3_preexisting_v603.webp) |

See the [Single Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md) topic for additional information. `24` - **Approved - Questioned**: the assignment was approved manually, then a change has been made in the assignment's source data via one of Identity Manager's workflows that should change the assignment but the manual approval is authoritative.

For example, when a user is assigned a SAP entitlement without having a SAP account, the account is created automatically with this state. ![Workflow State: Given by a Role](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/automationrule/118_givenbyarole_v603.webp) **Found** - Will match assignments not supported by a rule. ![Workflow State: Non-conforming](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/1_nonconforming_v603.webp) **Historic** - Will match assignments not supported by a rule, which existed before the production launch. ![Workflow State: Pre-existing](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/3_preexisting_v603.webp) |
