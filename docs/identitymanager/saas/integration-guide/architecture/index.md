# Architecture

This article dives deeper into Identity Manager's design principles. Security and flexibility are
the main concerns of the architecture.

## A Two-Tier Architecture

Identity Manager is made of two parts:

- The Identity Manager server operates the main process. It uses a dedicated database, serves the
  client side part of the web application and exposes its API.
- The Identity Manager agent operates data exchange with the information system. It implements a
  specific API called by the web client application.

Agent and server are [ASP.Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) applications running
on Windows. Identity Manager's database is a
[Microsoft SQLServer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server) relational database.

environment.

## Isolation Principle

Identity Manager server has no direct access to the information system of the organization. It can
be installed on an isolated network (typically in the cloud). Only the agent can read or write the
information system. All exchanges between agent and server are operated through the HTTP protocol
(HTTPS recommended in production).

## Unidirectional Command Flow

All reading or writing actions in the information system are initiated by the agent. Identity
Manager server will never call the agent. The Agent periodically polls the server to gather the
actions to process.

Tasks can run on the Server side or on the Agent side.

Tasks that run on the Server side are still executed by an Agent. This is the application of the
one-way data flow principle. Agents can send commands to the Server to execute a Task through an
HTTP request but the Server cannot command an Agent, hence isolating the sensitive Agents from the
exposed Server.

As a result, each set of planned Tasks is assigned to a specific Agent, depending on the managed
systems its Tasks relate to.

Agents also receive HTTP/HTTPS requests from the browser to allow authenticated end-users to launch
jobs from the UI.

## Authentication

Identity Manager can authenticate users within an Active Directory domain or using an OpenID
identity server. For development mode, Identity Manager implements a form-based authentication using
a unique password for all users See the
[ End-User Authentication](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/network-configuration/server-configuration/end-users-authentication/index.md)
topic for additional information.

## Multi-Agent Capability

Multiple agents can be installed. This allows Identity Manager to operate in a context where the
information system is partitioned over several networks.
