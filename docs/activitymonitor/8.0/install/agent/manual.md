## (Optional) Command Line Installation

If needed, the following command line options can be used with extra logging and install options.
The Activity Monitor Agent command line has the following parameters:

- AGENT_PORT

    - To specify Activity Monitor Agent port.
    - Default value: “4498”
    - AGENT_PORT=1234

- AGENTINSTALLLOCATION

    - To specify the Activity Monitor Agent installation path.
    - Default value: “C:\Program Files\Netwrix\Activity Monitor\Agent”
    - AGENTINSTALLLOCATION=“D:\AMAgent”

- MANAGEMENT_GROUP

    - To specify the Activity Monitor Agent Management Group (This allows user to limit users in the
      specified group to manage agents, but does not allow users in specified group to install,
      upgrade, or uninstall agents).
    - Default value: “BUILTIN\Administrators”
    - MANAGEMENT_GROUP=AMDOMAIN\AMGROUP

- /l\*v

    - To include verbose install logging.
    - /l\*v "C:\amagent.log"

    **NOTE:** If installation fails, locate the log file, and search for "Return value 3". The lines
    above "Return value 3" should contain information on what caused the installation to fail.

- /qn

    - To install the agent in quiet / Unattended Mode (without UI)

Example:

`msiexec.exe /i C:\SBFileMonAgent.msi AGENT_PORT=1234 AGENTINSTALLLOCATION=“D:\AMAgent” MANAGEMENT_GROUP=AMDOMAIN\AMGROUP /l*v c:\amagent.log /qn`

## Add the Activity Agent to the Console

Before deploying the Activity Monitor agent, ensure all
[Activity Agent Server Requirements](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/requirements/activityagent.md) have been met, including
those for NAS devices when applicable.

**NOTE:** These steps are specific to deploying activity agents for monitoring file systems,
SharePoint, SQL Server, Azure and Office 365 environments. See the
[Active Directory Agent Deployment](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/agents/add/activedirectory.md) section for
instruction on deploying the AD agent. See the
[Linux Agent Deployment](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/agents/add/linux.md) topic for instructions on deploying agents
to Linux servers.

Follow the steps to deploy the activity agent to a single Windows server.

**Step 1 –** Open the Activity Monitor Console.

**Step 2 –** On the Agents tab, click **Add Agent**. The Add New Agent(s) window opens.

**Step 3 –** Specify the server name where the agent will be deployed. To add multiple server names,
see the [Multiple Activity Agents Deployment](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/agents/add/multiple.md) topic for
additional information. Click **Next**.

![Agent Port Configuration](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/install/agent/portdefault.webp)

**Step 4 –** Specify the port to be used for the agent. Click **Next**.

![Credentials to connect to servers](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/install/agent/credentials.webp)

**Step 5 –** On the Credentials to Connect to the Server(s) page, specify the credentials for the
server to which the agent is deployed. See the
[Single Activity Agent Deployment](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/agents/add/single.md) topic for additional
information on credential options. Click **Connect**.

**NOTE:** When clicking **Connect** while adding the Agent to the Console, the connection may fail.
When clicking Connect, the Activity Monitor verifies not only its ability to manage the agent but
the console's ability to deploy the agent as well. Errors can be ignored if the agent was manually
installed.

**Step 6 –** Regardless of the warning messages that the agent cannot be installed or upgraded,
click **Next**. The console will automatically detect the agent as it is already installed.

![Agent Install Location](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/install/agent/installlocation.webp)

**Step 7 –** Specify the path of the Activity Monitor Agent, that has already been installed. Click
**Next**.

![Windows Agent Settings](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/install/agent/windowsagent.webp)

**Step 8 –** Specify the Activity Monitor Agent Management Group (if desired). Click Finish.

**NOTE:** The Activity Monitor Agent Management Group allows users in the specified group to manage
agents, but does not allow users in specified group to install, upgrade, or uninstall agents.

The Agent is now added to the Activity Monitor.

During the installation process of the agent, the status will display Installing. If there are any
errors, the Activity Monitor stops the installation and lists the errors in the Agent messages box.

When the Activity Monitor agent installation is complete, the status changes to **Installed** and
the activity agent version populates. The next step is to add hosts to be monitored.
