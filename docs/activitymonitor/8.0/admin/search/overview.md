# Search Feature

The search feature consolidates and compartmentalizes search results based on events, time, objects,
users, hosts, etc. Search results populate based on which query filters are chosen. Results may then
be sorted, filtered, and/or exported into a CSV file or JSON file, depending on the type data.

Choose between checking/unchecking the desired field values from the list of available values and
typing in the search textbox. The Clear filter option removes all filters from the selected column.
A filter icon appears on the header where filters have been applied. Multiple columns can be
filtered in the search results data grid.

**NOTE:** The columns that can be filtered will vary depending on what results are.

## Sort

Clicking on any column header in the search results data grid sorts the results alphanumerically for
that column, and an arrow shows next to the column name indicating the sort to be ascending or
descending order.

![Sort Options](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/search/sort.webp)

The drop-down menu on the column header has options to Sort A to Z or Sort Z to A for the selected
column. Sorting can only occur for one column at a time.

**NOTE:** The columns that can be sorted will vary depending on what results are.
