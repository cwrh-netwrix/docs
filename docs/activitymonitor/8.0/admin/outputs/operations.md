- Suppress reporting of File Explorer's excessive directory traversal activity – When you open a
  folder, Windows File Explorer tends to read all sub-folders to display proper icons and meta-data.
  This activity occurs without the explicit intent of the user. This option tries to suppress such
  automatic activity. It is only available when the Read / List option for Directory Operations is
  selected.
- Suppress reporting of File Explorer's excessive file read activity – When you open a folder,
  Windows File Explorer tends to read files in the folder to display proper icons and meta-data.
  This activity occurs without the explicit intent of the user. This option tries to suppress such
  automatic activity. It is only available when the Read option for File Operations is selected.
- Suppress Permission Change operations with reordered ACL – Prevents tracking events where
  permission updates occurred resulting in reordered ACEs, but with no other changes in the ACL
- Suppress Inherited Permissions Changes – Prevents tracking events where changes for inherited
  permissions occurred. This option is provided to improve overall performance and reduce output log
  volume.
- Suppress Microsoft Office operations on temporary files – Filters out events for Microsoft Office
  temporary files. When Microsoft Office files are saved or edited, many temporary files are
  created. With this option enabled, events for these temporary files are ignored.
- Suppress operations on common temporary files – Filters out events for common temporary files.
  With this option enabled, events for these common temporary files are ignored.
