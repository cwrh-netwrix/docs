**Step 7 –** On the Enterprise Manager Location Information page, select the **Option** button for a
product to enable communication with it.

- Select the **SAM configuration file** radio button.
- In the **Address or Path** field, enter the path to the activity agent configuration file for this
  host. Remember, the Activity Monitor activity agent must already be deployed on the domain
  controller and enabled before installing the AD Agent. The default path is:
  `…\STEALTHbits\StealthINTERCEPT\SIWindowsAgent\SAMConfig.xml`
- The port configuration only applies to the Enterprise Manager Host option.
- Configure additional Agent options as desired:

    - Safe Mode

        - The Safe Mode option prevents the **Windows AD Events** monitoring module from loading if
          the LSASS DLL versions has been modified since the last time the Threat Prevention Windows
          Agent service was started.

    - Start Agent Service

        - The **Start Agent Service** option starts the Threat Prevention Windows Agent service
          after the installation is complete. If the Threat Prevention Windows Agent service is not
          started at the time of installation, the Activity Monitor Agent will start as needed.

    - Create Windows Firewall Rules

        - The **Create Windows Firewall Rules** option creates the rules needed to open this port
          during the installation process. If using a third party firewall, uncheck this option and
          manually create the necessary firewall rules.

- When the settings are configured, click **Next**.

**Step 8 –** Select the domain controller(s) where the agent is installed. Click **Test**.

**NOTE:** When clicking Test while adding the Agent to the Console, the connection may fail. When
clicking Test, the Activity Monitor verifies not only its ability to manage the agent but the
console's ability to deploy the agent as well. Errors can be ignored if the agent was manually
installed.

**Next**.

agents, but does not allow users in specified group to install, upgrade, or uninstall agents.

The Agent is now added to the Activity Monitor Console.
