you select **Exchange Online** from the magnifying glass drop-down menu, a New Search tab opens with
the applicable query filters.

The filters are separated into the following categories:

- [General Category](#general-category)
- [User Category](#user-category)
- [Target Category](#target-category)
- [DLP Category](#dlp-category)

By default, the query is set to return all event activity for the past day. Configuring query
filters will scope results returned.

Set the filters as desired and click **Search**. The application searches through the appropriate
activity log files and returns the events that match the filters.You can
[Filter](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/search/overview.md#filter) and
[Sort](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/search/overview.md#sort) the
results using the column headers. Below the Search button is the
[Export](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/search/overview.md#export)
option.
