# Linux Agent Deployment

Understanding Linux File Activity Monitoring

The Activity Monitor can be configured to monitor the following:

- Ability to collect all or specific file activity for specific values or specific combinations of
  values

It also provides the ability to feed activity data to other Netwrix products:

- Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- Netwrix Threat Manager

Prior to adding a Windows host to the Activity Monitor, the prerequisites for the target environment
must be met. See the
[Linux Agent Server Requirements](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/requirements/linuxagent.md) topic
for additional information.

## Deploy Linux Agent

Follow the steps to deploy the agent to the Linux host.

**Step 1 –** On the Agents tab, click Add agent to open the Add New Agent(s) window.

**Step 2 –** On the Install New Agent page, enter the server name for the Linux host. Click
**Next**.

![Specify Agent Port](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/install/agent/portdefault.webp)

**Step 3 –** On the Agent Port page, specify the port to be used by the new agent. The default port
is **4498**. Click **Next**.

**Step 4 –** On the Credentials To Connect To The Server(s) page, connect to the Linux Server using
either a **User name** and **Password**, or a Public Key.

The options for connecting with a Password are:

- User name
- Password

![Public Key Credentials](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/agents/add/publickey.webp)

The options for connecting with a Public Key are:

- User name
- Private Key

![Client Certificate Credentials](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/agents/add/clientcertificate.webp)

To connect with a Client Certificate, select the **Client Certificate** (for already installed
agents) option. Run the following commands on the Linux machine:

```
cd /usr/bin/activity-monitor-agentd/
./activity-monitor-agentd create-client-certificate --name [name]
```

The Client Certificate option adds an already installed agent to the console without using SSH.

To connect with a public key, select the **Public Key** option. Copy the following command into a
command prompt to generate ECDSA key for public key option:

```
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t ecdsa
```

Netwrix Activity Monitor requires to generate ECDSA Key with a blank passphrase

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**NOTE:** It is required to add public key to authorized keys for Activity Monitor. By default, a
private key is generated at ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa location along with the public key (.pub file). A user
can use a different file location. Copy the following command into a command prompt to generate a
private key for Activity Monitorto use:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
```

**Step 5 –** Click **Connect** to test the connection. If the connection is successful, click
**Next**. If the connection is unsuccessful, see the status message that appears for information on
the failed connection.

**Step 6 –** On the Linux Agent Options page, select which user name to use to run the daemon. To
use root, leave the **Service user name** field blank. Click **Test** to test the connection.

**Step 7 –** Click **Finish**. The Add New Agent(s) window closes, and the activity agent is
deployed to and installed on the target host.

During the installation process, the status will be **Installing**. If there are any errors,
Activity Monitor stops the installation and lists the errors in the **Agent messages** box.

![Linux Agent Installed](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/agents/add/activitymonitorwithlinuxagentinstalled.webp)

When the Linux agent installation is complete, the status changes to **Installed**. The Monitored
Host is also configured, and the added Linux host is displayed in the monitored hosts table. See the
[Monitored Hosts Tab](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

Once a host has been added for monitoring, configure the desired outputs. See the
[Output for Monitored Hosts](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/output.md)
topic for additional information.

## Host Properties for Linux

Configuration settings can be edited through the tabs in the host’s Properties window. The
configurable host properties are:

- [Inactivity Alerts Tab](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/properties/inactivityalerts.md)

See the
[Host Properties Window](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/properties/overview.md)
topic for additional information.
