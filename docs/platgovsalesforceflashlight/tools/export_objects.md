# Export Objects

Administrators can use this to export one or more objects, including all child objects, into a
single view for easy review and management. For each export, you select the settings and optional
profiles and permission sets to include in the object details. The export is done in the background
to avoid timing out or exceeding the Salesforce Governor Limits. You will receive an email with a
link to the [Export Object Attachment](/docs/platgovsalesforceflashlight/tools/export_object_attachment_records.md) record, where you can
download your file.

:::note
Strongpoint stores Object-level permissions in a Custom Object. There are two reports
(**Flashlight** > **Reports / List Views** > **Customizations**) for easy access to this
information: **Permissions by Object** and **Object Permissions by Profile**
:::

1. Open **Flashlight** > **Tools** > **Export Objects**
   **Objects** is the default tab. **Profiles and Permission Sets** and **Users** exports are on
   their own
   tabs.![export_object_800x500](/images/platgovsalesforceflashlight/tools/export_object_800x500.webp)
2. Scroll through the **Select Objects to be Exported**, or enter all or part of a name in
   **Filter** to filter the list.
3. Select one or more objects in the scroll box. Use **Shift** or **Ctrl** to select multiple
   objects.
4. Click the right arrow to move the items to the **Selected Objects** list. To remove an item from
   the **Selected Objects** list, select it and click the left arrow.

### ObjectExport.xls File

When you open an exported file, this message may be displayed, as the exported _ObjectExport.xls_
file is in XMLÂ instead of the Excel format. Click **Yes** to load the file.

The _ObjectExport.xls_ file contains a **Summary** tab and a separate tab for each selected object.

The **Summary** tab shows who created the export, the creation date and time, list of selected
objects, and lists of any selected optional Profiles and Permission Sets.
