# Accessing Reports

The Flashlight **Reports / List Views** tab has links to all of the predefined reports and log
files.

You can define and save your own reports.

- Customization objects have additional data to enable searching with complex queries. For example,
  search for _all objects with script dependencies that have not been used for six months_, _or all
  objects used by workflows_.
- You can filter test scripts from regular scripts. Test scripts can be queried to review test
  coverage and determine if they being used.
