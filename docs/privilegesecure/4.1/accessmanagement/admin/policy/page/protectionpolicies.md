# Protection Policies Page

Protection policies are used to protect specific resources and can only be accessed by specific
users and groups. Essentially, all members who are not specified in the
[Allowed Members Tab for Protection Policies](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/accessmanagement/admin/policy/tab/policyprotection/allowedmembers.md)
are removed from the resource.

Protection policies can also be created to reserve resources for specific people or groups such as
executive team resources, business critical resources or shared resources.

The Protection Policies page is accessible from the Navigation pane under Policy. It shows the
configured protection policies, which are used to monitor local groups on a resource for changes.
Only users or groups added to the protection policy are permitted. When the resource is scanned, any
local group members that are not listed on the
[Allowed Members Tab for Protection Policies](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/accessmanagement/admin/policy/tab/policyprotection/allowedmembers.md)
are removed from the resource.

It is also possible to add the action _Invoke Protection Policy_ to the Post Session group of an
activity. This will proactively run all protection policies that apply to the target resource when
the session completes, instead of waiting for the scheduled sync. See the
[Activities Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/activities.md)
topic for additional information.
