# Password Complexity Page

The Password Complexity page is accessible from the Navigation pane under Policy > Platforms. It
shows configured password complexity policies that can be applied to platforms.

When Privilege Secure creates a managed account on a local system or domain it also sets the user
password. The password that is generated will follow the complexity rules configured in the related
password policy associated with that platform. The Default policy is used if a password policy
cannot be determined. See the
[Platforms Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/platforms/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

Password complexity requirements must adhere to any domain or local password policy applied to the
target resource. If there is a conflict between the password policy on the target resource and the
password policy set in Privilege Secure, the managed account cannot be created and the session will
fail.

Create password policies and configure the password complexity requirements on this page. The
password policy only applies to managed accounts created by Privilege Secure.
