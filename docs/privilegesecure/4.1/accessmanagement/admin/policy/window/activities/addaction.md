**Step 4 –** Complete the following fields:

- Action Type - Icon indicates the type of object.
- AD Object Type - AD Object Type — Select which type of object to manage in the Organizational
  Unit, a User or Computer..
- AD Organizational Unit for the Action - AD Organizational Unit — Enter a pre-existing
  Organizational Unit the login account will have delegated permissions for.
- AD Rights to be Added - AD Rights to be Added — Select which right will be delegated to the login
  account for managing the previously specified Organizational Unit.
- Continue on Error - Continue on Error — If an error occurs, continue to the next step rather than
  halting the action.
- Action Name - Action Name — (Optional) Edit the name of the action.
- Paired Actions Name - Paired Action's Name — (Optional) Edit the name of the paired action

See the
[Action Types](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/accessmanagement/admin/policy/activityactiontypes.md)
section for detailed descriptions of the fields.

**NOTE:** The fields will change depending on the selected Action Type.

**Step 5 –** Click Okay to create the new action.

**Step 6 –** Continue to create as many actions for each stage of the session (Grant, Connect,
Remove) as required.

**NOTE:** It is not possible to change the Action Type once the action is created. Delete the
existing action and then create a new action to get a new Action Type.

**Step 7 –** If desired, it is possible to automatically run any Protection Policies associated with
the resource when the session completes. Simply add the _Invoke Protection Policies_ action to the
Post-Session group. See the
[Protection Policies Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/protectionpolicies.md)
topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** It is not necessary to select a protection policy. All protection policies that apply to
the session host are executed.

The new actions are added to the activity.
