The Historical Sessions table has the following features:

- Search — Searches the table or list for matches to the search string. When matches are found, the
  table or list is filtered to the matching results.
- Filter — Provides options to filter results based on a chosen criterion:

    - Resource Name – Filter by Host value
    - Requested date — Filter by session start and/or end dates

- Export as CSV — Generates a CSV file of the table and automatically downloads it to your browser's
  default download folder. The file name indicates what table was exported.
- Refresh — Reload the information displayed

The table has the following columns:

- Actions — Contains icons for available actions:

    - Expand icon — Click the expand () icon to show additional information
    - Rocket icon — Launches the same session (same activity on the same resource with the same
      connection profile) for any historical session that is not a Credential-based session
    - View logs icon — Opens the Session Logs window to view the action log for the selected
      session. See the [Session Logs Window](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/accessmanagement/enduser/dashboard/window/sessionlogs.md) topic for additional
      information.

- Requested — Date and time of when the session was created
- Status — Shows status information for the session:

    - Canceled — Activity was manually canceled before its scheduled end time by an Privilege Secure
      administrator
    - Failed — Pre-Session stage of the Activity has encountered an error
    - Completed — Activity either reached the end of its scheduled end time or was canceled early by
      the requestor

- Session User— User who requested the session
- Host — Resource that the user will run the activity on
- Login Account — Displays the account used to log onto the resource
- Activity — Displays the name of the activity
- Start — Indicates when the activity started. This refers to when the activity’s actions were
  executed and not when the user was logged on to the resource.
- Duration — Indicates how long the Activity ran for until it either reached its scheduled end time
  or was manually canceled by the user or an Privilege Secure administrator
- Notes — Any notes that were entered when the session was created
- Ticket Number — Any ticket numbers that were entered when the session was created

The table columns can be resized and sorted in ascending or descending order.
