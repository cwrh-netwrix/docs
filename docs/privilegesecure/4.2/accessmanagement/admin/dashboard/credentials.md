# Credentials Dashboard

The Credentials dashboard shows all accounts discovered within your environment. It is specifically
focused on managing service account password rotation. A managed account is any host local account,
domain account, or Privilege Secure application local account that has its credentials managed by
the application. This includes managed user accounts created by activity sessions. The Credentials
dashboard displays the same information as the [Credentials Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/credentials.md).

The dashboard has the following features:

- Search — Searches the table or list for matches to the search string. When matches are found, the
  table or list is filtered to the matching results. You can search for a specific host or account.
- Filter — Provides options to filter results based on a chosen criterion:

    - Method — Filter by whether the account is managed by the application: All, Managed, and
      Unmanaged. Managed accounts include both Automatic managed and Manual managed.
    - Managed Type — Filter by account type: All, Internal, Standard, and Service. An Internal
      account is a Privilege Secure application local account.
    - Privilege Type — Filter by type of privilege the account has: Not Set, Administrator, Power
      User, Guest, User, Sudoer, Linux User, Cisco Privilege 0, Cisco Privilege 1, and Cisco
      Privilege 15

  when the account Managed Type is Standard or Internal. For an Internal account, a pop up window

  section for additional information.
- Unmanage — Remove the account from being managed by Privilege Secure
- Rotate Service Account — Opens the Account Dependencies window. This button is only available when

  [Account Dependencies Window](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/accessmanagement/admin/policy/window/credentials/accountdependencies.md) topic for
  additional information.
- Schedule Rotation — Add the credential rotation task to the queue. This button is only available
  when the Method is Automatic managed. See the

  Privilege Secure
- View History — Opens the Password History window to displays the password history for the account.
