# Scheduler Service Install

The Scheduler Service is installed with Privilege Secure and can also be installed remotely on other
servers. This provides the option to run scheduled tasks defined in the console from different
locations within an organization. The Scheduler Service installer is in the zip file with the
Privilege Secure Console installer. It is also available for download from the Stealthbits website
if required.

**NOTE:** Before you begin, the Proxy Service must be installed on any server running services for
Privilege Secure. See the [Proxy Service Install](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/accessmanagement/install/proxyservice.md) topic for installation
instructions.

## Register the Remote Scheduler Service with Privilege Secure

If the Scheduler Service is installed on a remote machine, it must be configured to register with
the Privilege Secure server. This configuration is done by supplying the Privilege Secure server and
credentials in a command line utility. Both the key exchange and action service need to be
configured.

Follow the steps to configure the key exchange.

**Step 1 –** On the application server, run **cmd** as Administrator.

**Step 2 –** Type the following commands to export the encryption keys for the secondary:


Encryption Key Export

```
cd C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\PAM\KeyTools
.\SbPAM.RotateKey.exe export -n keys.exp
```

**Step 3 –** Take note of the password for the export file.

**CAUTION:** This temporary password protects the NPS-AM encryption keys during copying. Do not save
it to digital media or transmit it with the encryption key package.

**Step 4 –** Copy the export file to "C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\PAM\KeyTools" on the secondary
server.

**Step 5 –** On the (Action/Scheduler/Siem) service server, run cmd as Administrator.

**Step 6 –** Type the following commands to import the encryption keys:


Encryption Key Import

```
cd C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\PAM\KeyTools
.\SbPAM.RotateKey.exe import -n keys.exp
```

**Step 7 –** Enter the password when prompted.

**Step 8 –** Delete the export file from both the primary and secondary servers.

The key exchange is now configured.

Follow the steps to configure the Action Service.

**Step 1 –** Open a command prompt as an administrator.

**Step 2 –** Change the directory path to the location of the Privilege Secure Action Service. The
default path is:

C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\PAM\NPS.SchedulerService\

**Step 3 –** Run the following command to automatically register the scheduler service. Enter the
Admin password when prompted:

- The `[Privilege Secure]` parameter is the Host Name, IP, FQDN or URL
- The default `[Port]` parameter is 6500

    NPS.SchedulerService.exe –register -u admin [PrivilegeSecureServer:Port]

- For installations without a trusted https certificate on the Privilege Secure server, the “-I”
  parameter must be added:
- NPS.SchedulerService.exe –register -u admin -I [PrivilegeSecureServer:Port]
- The command prompt will show if the configuration was successful.

**Step 4 –** Exit the command prompt.

The remote Scheduler Service is now registered with Privilege Secure.
