# Prerequisites for Deployments in Remote IIS

To deploy Directory Manager portals and services (Data service and Security service) in remote IIS,
you must set up the following prerequisites:

- Install the required software
- Create a site in remote IIS for deploying the Directory Manager portal and services, and assign
  permissions
- Generate an access key for the Microsoft IIS Administration API

## Prerequisite Software

Before you can deploy Directory Manager portals and services in remote IIS, make sure the following
prerequisite software is installed on the remote IIS machine. Install them in the following order:

1. ASP.NET Core Runtime 6.0.30 (Hosting Bundle)  
   Click [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-6.0.30-windows-hosting-bundle-installer)
   to download.
2. .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0.30  
   Click [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.30-windows-x64-installer)
   to download.
3. ASP.NET Core Runtime 2.1.25 (Hosting Bundle)  
   Click [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/2.1) to download.
4. Microsoft IIS Administration 2.3.0  
   Click [here](https://github.com/microsoft/IIS.Administration/releases/tag/v2.3.0) to download.

## Create a Site in Remote IIS

As a prerequisite to deploying a Directory Manager application in remote IIS, you need to create a
site there and assign appropriate permissions to it. Directory Manager portals and services should
be created within this site.

**To create a site in remote IIS:**

1. Launch Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager (see
   [Opening IIS Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/iis/6.0-sdk/ms525920(v=vs.90).
2. In the left pane, right-click **Sites** and select **Add Website**.

3. Enter the information as shown below and click **OK**:

    ![Add Website window](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/portal/addwebsite.webp)

    1. Enter a name for the site in the **Site name** box.
    2. Create a new folder on the remote machine and bind this site to that folder. Provide the
       physical path of the newly created folder in the **Physical path** box. When you create a
       Directory Manager application in the site, a sub-folder will be created within this folder
       and application files will be copied to it.
    3. Provide binding information in the **Binding** section.

        - Type: HTTPS
        - Port: any available port

    4. Select an SSL certificate from the **SSL certificate** dropdown list.

### Assign Permissions

The next step is to assign permissions on the physical folder that binds to your site in remote IIS.

1. Go to the physical path of your IIS site folder and provide the full control to a local group
   IIS_IUSRS on this folder.  
   To assign these permissions:

    1. Right click the group you created and select **Properties**.
    2. Select the **Security** tab.
    3. Click **Edit**.
    4. Click **Add**.
    5. Click **Locations**.
    6. Select your machine name from the list in the **Locations** box. Click **OK**.
    7. In the **Enter the object names** box type _IIS_IUSRS_ and click the **Check Names** button.
       The group name should appear as follows:

        ```
        `<your machine name>`\IIS_IUSRS
        ```

    8. Click **OK**.
    9. Allow Full Control to _IIS_IUSRS_ group.
    10. Click **Apply** and then click **OK**.
    11. Click **OK** to close the **Permissions for `<folder name>`** dialog box.
    12. Click **OK** to close the **`<folder name>` Properties** dialog box.
    13. The required permissions have been assigned to the folder.

2. After assigning the permissions, go to the following path

    ```
       C:\Program Files\IIS Administration\2.3.0\Microsoft.IIS.Administration\config\
    ```

3. Open the **appsettings.json** file and add the highlighted script at the end of the file:

    ![Script for appsettings.json file](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/portal/appsettings-full.webp)

4. The script to be added is given below:

    ```
       },
       "files": {
           "locations": [
             {
               "alias": "<site_name>",
               "path": "<site_folder_name>",
               "claims": [
                 "read",
                 "write"
               ]
             }
           ]
         }

    ```

    Remember, to provide values for alias "site name" and path "physical folder location of the
    site", created in the section Create a Site in Remote IIS.

## Generate an Access Key

Admin Center uses the
[Microsoft IIS Administration API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis-administration/) to
communicate with remote IIS. Make sure this API is instphysical folder location of the site",
created in the section Create a Site in Remote IISalled as a Windows service on the remote IIS
machine.

To connect to the API, an access key is required. Follow the steps below to generate it.

1. Go to _https://localhost:55539/_ to launch the Microsoft Administration API interface.  
   Note that this is the default URL. It may change for reasons such as when a different port is
   used.
2. Click **ACCESS KEYS**.

3. Click **Create Access Key** to generate an access key and provide the following information:

    ![Access Key Purpose window](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/portal/accesskeyspurpose.webp)

4. On clicking **Create**, the access key is generated.
