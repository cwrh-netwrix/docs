# Specify Smart Group Query Attributes

For an identity store, you can choose whether all or specific schema attributes should be available
on the following pages in the portal:

- The Query Designer, where you can specify queries for Smart Groups and Dynasties for membership
  update. The Query Designer can be launched from:

    - The Create Object wizard for Smart Groups and Dynasties
    - The properties page for Smart Groups and Dynasties
    - When you upgrade a static group to a Smart Group or Dynasty

    The schema attributes you specify would be available to portal users on the Filter Criteria tab
    of the Query Designer for building Smart Group/Dynasty queries.

- The Sub-Manager Query Designer for a Recursive Managerial Dynasty, where you can specify a query
  for sub-manager selection.

- The **Add Attributes** dialog box for Dynasties. The schema attributes you specify would be
  available in the _Group Items By_ field, which is used to divide the query results into groups.
  Directory Manager creates a new child group for each unique value of the attribute that users
  select in the _Group Items By_ field.

- The Query Designer for importing members to a group using an external data source. The specified
  schema attributes would be available on the Filter Criteria tab of the Query Designer for building
  membership import queries.  
  You can launch this Query Designer using the **Import** button on the **Members** tab in group
  properties (for static groups, Smart Groups and Dynasties).  
  ![importmembers](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/portal/design/importmembers.webp)
- The Query Designer for query-based search, where users can define a query to search the
  directory.  
  The schema attributes you specify would be available to portal users on the Filter Criteria tab of
  the Query Designer for building search queries.  
  Users can launch the Query Designer for searches from the portal’s Advanced Search page.

You can also specify the following for an attribute:

- The operator(s) that can be applied to the attribute on the Query Designer dialog boxes. For
  example, if you allow the ‘Contains’ and ‘Equals’ operators for the ‘cn’ attribute, then only
  these operators will be displayed when users select the ‘cn’ attribute on any of the Query
  Designers.
- The display type to use for specifying the value of the attribute. For example, it can be a simple
  text box, a drop-down list, or a button that launches the Find dialog box for searching and
  selecting an object.
- The maximum number of characters that users can enter as value for an attribute.
