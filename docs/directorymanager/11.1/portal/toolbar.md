| ![expire](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/expire.webp)                              | The behavior of this button depends on the expiry policy of the selected group. - When the group has its expiry policy set to ‘never expire’, clicking this button displays an error message that the group cannot be expired. - When the group has an expiry policy other than ‘never expire’, clicking this button expires the group and moves it to the My Expired Groups page. - A group without an expiry policy will not expire. Directory groups that are created outside of Directory Manager do not have an expiry policy.                                                                                                                                 |
