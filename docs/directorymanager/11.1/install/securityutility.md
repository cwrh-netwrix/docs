# Security Utility

The NDM11-ADV-2025-014 utility is used to:

- Restrict the IP addresses that can access Directory Manager services.
- Generate and encrypt the password for the GroupID user account, which is a hard-coded account
  hidden from end-users. This account is used to authenticate from Security Service for the
  Replication service, Email service, and Scheduler service.

## Restrict IP Addresses

The NDM11-ADV-2025-014 utility adds an IIS IP security rule to prevent remote access to internal
Directory Manager services. To achieve this, the utility:

1. Defines 127.0.0.1,::1, and the host's primary public address as an IIS IP security rule.
2. Detects whether the primary public address is obtained from DHCP and alerts that dynamically
   assigned addresses may present operational challenges. A DHCP Reservation or statically
   configured IP should be used for the Directory Manager server.
3. Allows you to add additional addresses to support remote Directory Manager servers.
4. The following services/virtual directories have the IP rule applied:

    - GroupIDDataService
    - GroupIDEmailService
    - GroupIDReplicationService
    - GroupIDSchedulerService

Follow the steps to limit access to the Directory Manager services to specific IP addresses.

Step 1 – On the Directory Manager server, run the “NDM11-ADV-2025-014-Utility.exe” utility from the
command line as an administrator. This will present the following options:

- AddIpSecurity — Enables the IIS IP Security feature on the Directory Manager server
- GenerateSecurePassword — Generates a secure password for the GroupID user account
- --help — Displays details about a specific command
- version — Displays the NDM11-ADV-2025-014-Utility version

Step 2 – Run the `NDM11-ADV-2025-014-Utility.exe AddIpSecurity` cmdlet. This will enable the IIS IP
Security feature in Directory Manager and ask if there is any machine other than the local one that
accesses GroupIDDataService. If yes, provide the IP of that machine. Press Enter.

In case of multiple machines, use a comma to separate the IP addresses with no space after the
comma.

RECOMMENDED: Use a static IP address for the Directory Manager server and the additional IP
addresses you specify here to include in the IP security rules.

Step 3 – After successful configuration, the following message is displayed.

In the event of a Directory Manager multi-instance deployment, execute the above steps on each
Directory Manager server in your environment.

NOTE: In case you deploy a new Directory Manager server/instance, add the IP address of the new
server to the primary server's IP security rule allowed list. Run the NDM11-ADV-2025-014 utility on
the primary server to add the additional IP. This should be done before the new server connects to
the Data service on the primary server (this connection is required while configuring the new
server). Once the new server is configured, you can remove the IP from the allowed list of the
primary server.

## Generate a Secure Password

Follow the steps to generate and encrypt the password for the GroupID user account.

Step 1 – On the Directory Manager server, run the “NDM11-ADV-2025-014-Utility.exe” utility from the
command line as an administrator.

Step 2 – Next, run the `NDM11-ADV-2025-014-Utility.exe GenerateSecurePassword` cmdlet.

Step 3 – After that, provide the database configurations in the following cmdlet according to your
environment:

`NDM11-ADV-2025-014-Utility.exe GenerateSecurePassword -s "SQLSERVER" -i -u "sa" -d "NetwrixGroupIDDatabase"`

Step 4 – You will be asked to provide the database connection password. On doing so, the password
for the GroupID user account will be updated with the generated password.

## Export/Import the New Password

If you have multiple Directory Manager servers or distributed portals, you must also run the
GroupIDPasswordTransfer utility to securely transport the password to distributed Directory Manager
systems. When done, you must restart IIS on those systems.

Follow the steps to export the generated password from the primary Directory Manager server to a
secondary server/instance.

Step 1 – On the Directory Manager server, run the “directorymanagerPasswordTransferUtility.exe” utility from
the command line as an administrator.

Step 2 – Next, run the `directorymanagerPasswordTransferUtility.exe export -o "directory\filename"` cmdlet to
export the encrypted password from the primary server.

Step 3 – Copy the encrypted password displayed on cmd in response to this command.

Step 4 – Then copy the file created at the directory path provided in the cmdlet and place it on
another instance of Directory Manager.

Step 5 – Run the following cmdlet on the instance where you placed the file to import the encrypted
password.

directorymanagerPasswordTransferUtility.exe import -i "path to the file" -p "password copied from above"

Step 6 – Restart IIS on this server.

Repeat Steps 3-6 on all Directory Manager servers to eliminate the hard-coded password for the
GroupID user account on all servers.

## Delete the GroupIDSSUser Account

You must delete the GroupIDSSUser account from each Directory Manager server. Go to the Computer
Management console to delete the account.
