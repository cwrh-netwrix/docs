    The **Forgot Password** and **Unlock Account** options are now available on the Windows logon
    screen. They route you to the URLs provided for these options in the _CPSettings.xml_ file. You

    Provide the text for the CPTitle key. This text will appear as title under the Netwrix logo on
    the Windows logon screen.

## Install GroupID Credential Provider via a Group Policy Object (GPO)

Instead of installing Credential Provider manually on each individual client workstation, you can
distribute it for automatic installation using a GPO, for substantial time savings (especially with
larger networks). The GPO can be defined for an organizational unit or applied on the entire domain.
Credential Provider is installed automatically at the next Windows startup.

Installing Credential Provider is a two-step process:

1. [Install Orca](#install-orca)
2. [Deploy Credential Provider via a GPO](#deploy-credential-provider-via-a-gpo)

### Install Orca

Before Credential Provider’s installation via GPO, Orca software is to be installed:

1. Browse to the folder where you have copied the Credential Provider package.
2. Go to the MST Guide folder and run the _Orca-x86_en-us.msi_ application. The Orca console opens:

    ![Orca console](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/manage/orca_console.webp)

3. In Orca, click **File** > **Open**. Browse to the Netwrix GroupID Credential Provider folder and
   load the _NetwrixdirectorymanagerCredentialprovider.msi_ in Orca.

4. From the menu, select **Transform** > **New Transform**:

    ![New Transform option](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/manage/new_transform.webp)

5. Click **Property** in the left pane, list of the properties are displayed in the **Property**
   main window:

6. On your machine, create a new folder and copy the following files to it:

    - CPsettings.xml
    - NetwrixdirectorymanagerCredentialprovider.msi

7. Share the folder with the Everyone group with Read permission.
8. Provide the path of this newly created folder in the **SOURCEPATH** box.

10. Type a filename for the generated .mst file and save it into the shared folder you just created.
11. Close **Orca**.

### Deploy Credential Provider via a GPO

Having Orca successfully installed, follow these steps to deploy Credential Provider via a GPO.

1. Launch **Group Policy Management** console by typing _gpmc.msc_ in the **Run** box and clicking
   **OK**. The Group Policy Management Editor opens.

    - CPSettings.xml
    - Netwrixdirectorymanagercredentialprovider.msi
    - .mst file

    Select the _Netwrixdirectorymanagercredentialprovider.msi_ and click **Ok**.

7. Browse to the shared folder where you saved the generated .mst file. Select that file and click
   **Ok**.
8. Close the Group Policy Management Editor.

The GroupID Credential provider is deployed on your machine via the default domain policy.

## Run the credential provider

1. Restart the machine  
   or  
   Run Command Prompt as administrator and type the following command in the cmd window:  
   gpupdate /force

## Run the credential provider on client machines

The modified domain policy will be installed on the client machines, which are in the scope of the
Group Policy Object, upon their next restart. The Windows logon screen appear as follows:
