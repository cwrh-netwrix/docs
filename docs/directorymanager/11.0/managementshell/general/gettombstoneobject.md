# Get-TombStoneObject

When you delete an object from Directory, the object is not physically removed from the database.
Instead, Directory marks the object as deleted, strips most of the properties from the object and
moves it to a special container. The object becomes invisible to normal directory operations and is
referred to as a tombstone object.

The **Get-TomStoneObject** commandlet let you view the information of these tombstone objects.

## Syntax
