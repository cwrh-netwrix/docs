[-AccidentalDeletion]
[-IdentityStoreId <int>]
[-SecurityToken <CustomClaimsPrincipal>]
[-Credential <pscredential>]
[<CommonParameters>]
```

## Required Parameters

- ContainerName
- OrganizationalUnit

Example 1:

The following command creates the organizational unit _Recruiting_ at the root level in Directory,
using the credentials of current user logged-on to the identity store.

```
New-Container -OrganizationalUnit "DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -ContainerName "Recruiting"
```

Example 2:

The following command creates the organizational unit _Local Recruiting_ inside the _Recruiting_
container in Directory using the credentials set in the $Credentials environment variable. See the
