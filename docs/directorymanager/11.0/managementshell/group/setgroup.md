# Set-Group

The **Set-Group** commandlet modifies an unmanaged group in directory. However, you can use this
commandlet to modify those parameters of a Smart Group that are native attributes of an unmanaged
group in Directory. For modifying Smart Group-specific attributes, you can use the
[Set-SmartGroup](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/smartgroup/setsmartgroup.md)
commandlet.

You can view events related to this commandlet in GroupID portal, against the **History** node in
the left panel.

## Required Parameter

- Identity

Example 1:

The following command changes the expiration policy of the **Training** group to 60 days and assigns
a manager to the group, using the credentials of current user logged-on to the identity store.

```
Set-Group -Identity "CN=Training,OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -ExpirationPolicy "60" -ExtendGroupLife -ManagedBy "CN=John Smith,CN=Users,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US"
```

Example 2:

The following command expires the group **Training**, using the credentials set in the
**$Credentials** environment variable. See the
[Set the $Credentials Environment Variable](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/setthecredential.md)
topic for setting credentials in an environment variable.

```
Set-Group -Identity "CN=Training,OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -IsExpired True -Credential $Cred
```

Example 3:

The following command gets all groups in the container **Recruiting**, clears their additional owner
lists and sets their expiration policy to **Never Expire.** The **OUT-NULL** commandlet has been
used to prevent the retrieved groups information from appearing on the console.

```
Get-Group -searchcontainer "OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" | Set-Group -AdditionalOwners "" -ExpirationPolicy "0" -ExtendGroupLife | OUT-NULL
```

Example 4:

The following command removes two additional owners from the **Training** group and adds three new
additional owners to the group and excludes an additional owner from receiving e-mail notifications.

```
Set-Group -Identity "CN=Training,OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -Remove @{AdditionalOwners = "CN=Roger_Manson,OU=ResignedStaff,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US","KillenEdward"} -Add @{AdditionalOwners = "RobinSoto","MeganFox","DollyChan"} -NotifyOptOutAdditionalOwners "RobinSoto"
```
