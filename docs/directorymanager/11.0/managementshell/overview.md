# GroupID Management Shell

GroupID Management Shell is a command-line interface for managing objects like users, contacts,
mailboxes, groups, smart groups, dynasties and for performing other administrative tasks in an
Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID based identity stores.

Built with PowerShell Core technology, GroupID Management Shell provides a platform to perform many
of the tasks you can perform with GroupID as well as tasks that the console does not support.

This documentation is a reference for the GroupID PowerShell commands. It provides detail on their
function, syntax, parameters, and gives ready-to-use examples that you can modify and test in your
own environment.

The documentation is intended for advanced users familiar with the use of the Windows Command prompt
and PowerShell Core.

## Identity Store-based Model

GroupID 11.0 has extensible identity store based model. It supports the following data stores for
creating an identity store:

- Active Directory
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Generic LDAP
- Google Workspace

:::note
The commandlets covered in this section are for Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID based
identity stores.

## Access GroupID Management Shell

Before using GroupID Management Shell, you must connect it to an identity store.

To access Management Shell:

1. On the Windows Start menu, search for **GroupID Management Shell 11.0**. Click it to launch
   GroupID Management Shell 11.0.
2. On the Netwrix GroupID Authenticate page, select an identity store to connect to.

    :::note
    If your required identity store is not listed, contact the GroupID administrator.
    :::


3. In the **Username** and **Password** boxes, provide the user name and password of your identity
   store account and click **Sign In**.

    ![Login page](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/login-2.webp)

    :::note
    Click the **Edit** icon if you want to select another identity store to connect to.
    :::


    The Management Shell window appears as follows:

    ![GroupID Management Shell 11.0](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/shell.webp)

    It displays information about the connected identity store.

You can now run GroupID Management Shell commandlets.

## Connect GroupID Management Shell Remotely

To enable remoting on a GroupID machine, the remote machine must have one of the following Operating
Systems:

- Windows Server 2016 or 2019 or 2022
- Windows Server Nano (1809 or higher)
- Windows 11
- Windows 10 1607+

Windows network location of that machine must be Domain or Private ("Home" or "Work"). If the
network location is Public, GroupID Management Shell cannot create the required firewall exception
for WS-Management Communication.

The Windows Management Shell remoting features are supported by the WS-Management protocol and the
Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service that implements WS-Management in Windows.

Also make sure the following is available at the remote machine:

- Windows Powershell 7.3.6
- Windows Remote Management 2.0

To enable remoting on a GroupID machine:

1. Click **Start > Windows Powershell**.

    Right-click Windows PowerShell and select **Run as administrator**.

2. At the command prompt, type:

    ```
       enable-psremoting
    ```

    ![powershellwindow](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/powershellwindow.webp)

:::note
By default, on Windows Server 2016, Windows PowerShell remoting is enabled. Use this command
to re-enable remoting on Windows Server 2016 if it becomes disabled.
:::


You have to run this command only one time on each computer that will receive commands. You do not
have to run it on computers that only send commands. Because the configuration starts listeners, it
is prudent to run it only where it is needed.

To verify that remoting is configured correctly, run a test command:

```
new-PSSession –ComputerName <computer name>
```

This command creates a remote session on the local computer and returns an object that represents
the session. The output should look as shown in the following snapshot:

### Access GroupID Management Shell Remotely

Log on to the machine through which you want to remotely access the **GroupID Management Shell** and
perform the following steps:

1. Right-click **Start > PowerShell 7.3.6** using the **Run as Administrator** command to open it
   with Administrator privileges.
2. At the prompt, type the following script. It will display the new session created for the remote
   machine.

    ```
       $username = "domain\username"
       $pass = ConvertTo-SecureString "user password" -AsPlainText -Force
       $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($username, $pass)
       $s = New-PSSession -ComputerName "machine name" -Credential $Cred -ConfigurationName PowerShell.7
       Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {$srcu = [reflection.assembly]::LoadFrom('C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\System.Windows.Forms.dll'); $OnAssemblyResolve = [System.ResolveEventHandler] { param($sender, $e) if ($e.Name -like "System.Windows.Forms, Version=*") { return $srcu }return $null;};[System.AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.add_AssemblyResolve($OnAssemblyResolve);$reg=Get-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\PowerShellSnapIns\Imanami.Groups.Management.PowerShell.Admin11; $appbase=$reg.ApplicationBase;Import-Module -Name $appbase\directorymanagerManagementShell\bin\Imanami.directorymanager.Management.dll;Set-ModulePath -ModulePath $appbase\GroupIDManagementShell\bin}
       Import-PSSession -Session $s -Type cmdlet -AllowClobber
       Connect-IdentityStore -mode "2" -IdentityStoreID "identity store id" -Credential $Cred
    ```

    Following line of the above script connects the current user to the identity store (_having ID
    1_).

    ```
    Connect-IdentityStore -mode "2" -IdentityStoreID "1" -Credential $Cred
    ```

    Using the following instructions, you can get the identity store ID from GroupID SQL database in
    which the desired identity store exists:

    1. Login to SQL server (having GroupID database) with account having read permissions.
    2. View the table “Svc.Identitystore” top 100 rows. See the following snapshot for details:

        ![groupiddatabase](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/directorymanagerdatabase.webp)

Once the script has run, a remote session will be created. You can now run all GroupID cmdlets
through PowerShell 7 without the need of signing into the GroupID server.
