If this setting is set to True, the flat operation is performed on the next update of the dynasty where it breaks its current hierarchy and re-builds the memberships of the parent group on the flat dynasty logic.

This can be a query statement and can include multiple columns separated by commas (,). The field names are enclosed in brackets ([ ]) to prevent any ambiguity that the query engine might encounter because of spaces between column names. GroupID Management Shell also needs to know how the information in the source relates to the directory so it can find the recipients identified in the data source in the directory and add them to the group. This relation is defined through the LdapFilter parameter. If no match is found, the data source entry will be skipped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Under its default value False, the life of unused groups is always extended as soon as they reach their expiration date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This parameter allows you to collapse several different values into one. Use any of the following as a value of this parameter: - `<Blank value>` - Do not use any filter and create a group for each distinct value of the attribute. - Left `<Number of characters>` - Selects the specified number of characters from the attribute starting from the left-end of the string. Each distinct set of selected characters from the group-by attribute is then used to create a group. - Right `<Number of characters>` - Selects the specified number of characters from the attribute starting from the right-end of the string. Each distinct set of selected characters from the group-by attribute is then used to create a group. - %GROUPBY%/`<the part of the value to leave out>` - Use this filter when you have a character separator. Specifying this filter creates a group for each distinct value of the portion of the attribute selected. %GROUPBY% represents the significant portion of the value. After the slash, you can specify the portion you want to leave out of the attribute's value. Specifying \* after the slash leaves out any portion of the value that occurs after the slash. For multiple group-by attributes, provide a filter values for each attribute separated by a comma (,). |

Under its default behavior, unused distributions groups are never expired. As soon as, they reach their expiration date, their life is extended by reapplying the expiration policy on them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The default value 0 retains all history data of the actions specified by the ChangeTrackerActions setting. You can change it to any of the following values: - 1 (for 30 days) - 2 (for 60 days) - 3 (for 90 days) - 4 (for 120 days) - 5 (for 6 months) - 6 (for 1 year) - 7 (for 2 years) - 8 (for 5 years) The setting does not destroy the older history data. Rather, it exports the older data to an Excel file for later reference. This Excel file is created in the HistoryBin folder in the GroupID installation directory. Group Management Service performs the history data export. With every execution of the service, it checks the specified period against Keep History option for the domain and exports the older data to the Excel file (if found).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Imanami Email Service maintains a queue of all notifications to be sent by GroupID and ensures that they are delivered when the SMTP server is down. If this parameter is left out, the notification e-mail is sent directly without being added to the notification queue. Consequently, if the configured SMTP server is down, the e-mail is lost.

Values to this parameter are supplied as a 3-length array. - The first index contains the filter name which can be one of the 'name' or 'type' representing 'client name' and 'client type' respectively. - The second index contains the operator which can be either 'is exactly' or 'is not'. - The third index contains the value. It can either be the client type or client name, depending on the value in the first index. Example: @('name', 'is exactly', 'automate arslanahmadvm') is a valid filter criteria. However, @('client type', 'is not', 'managementshell') is not valid because the value at first index is not correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
