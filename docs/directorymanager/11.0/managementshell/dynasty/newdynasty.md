# New-Dynasty

The **New-Dynasty** cmdlet creates a new Dynasty in Directory. A Dynasty is a Smart Group that can
create and maintain the membership of other Smart Groups. A Dynasty retrieves data from Directory in
the same manner as a Smart Group, but it divides the result set into child groups based on group-by
field values.

You can specify multiple group-by fields. For instance, with the group-by fields Country, State, and
City, this commandlet creates a group for every distinct country value, then for each state within a
country, and finally for each city in that state. All created child groups inherit those attributes
of the parent that are set in the **InheritedAttrs** option.

You can view events related to this commandlet in GroupID portal, against the **History** node in
the left panel.

## Required Parameters

- TopManager
- SamAccountName
- Name
- OrganizationalUnit
- GroupScope
- Type
- SecurityType

Example 1:

The following command creates a new mail-enabled, universal, distribution Dynasty and constructs its
child groups for every distinct department value in the container specified by the
**OrganizationalUnit** parameter using the credentials of current user logged-on to the identity
store.

```
New-Dynasty -OrganizationalUnit "OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -Name "Departmental" -SamAccountName  "Departmental" -Type "Distribution" -GroupScope "Universal Group" -MailEnable True -GroupAlias "Departmental" -GroupBy  "Department"
```

Example 2:

The following command creates a new mail-enabled, universal, distribution, multi-level Dynasty with
the group-by attributes **Country, State** and **City** based on the specified filters and
separator, using the credentials set in the **$Credentials** environment variable. See the
[Set the $Credentials Environment Variable](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/setthecredential.md)
topic for setting credentials in an environment variable.

```
New-Dynasty -OrganizationalUnit "OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -Name "Geographical" -GroupAlias "Geographical" -MailEnable True -SamAccountName "Geographical" -GroupScope "Universal Group" -Type "Distribution" -GroupBy "co","st","l" -Filters "Left 3","Left 3","%GROUPBY%\*" -Separator "_","_","_" -Credential $Cred
```

Example 3:

The following command creates a new universal, distribution Managerial Dynasty in the container
specified by the **OrganizationalUnit** parameter, searches the direct reports of the top manager in
the containers specified in the **SearchContainers** parameter including sub containers and creates
them in the same container where the Top Manager resides.

```
New-Dynasty -OrganizationalUnit "OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -Name "Managerial" -SamAccountName "Managerial" -GroupScope "Universal Group" -Type "Distribution" -SearchContainers "OU=Recruiting,OU=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US","OU=Outsourcing,OU=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -SearchContainersScopeList "2","2" -TopManager "CN=BrianRegan,CN=Users,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -ExcludeNestedLists False -ChildContainer ""
```
