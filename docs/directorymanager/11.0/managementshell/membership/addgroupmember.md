# Add-GroupMember

The **Add-GroupMember** commandlet helps you to add one or more objects to the membership of a group
in Directory. Two types of membership can exist in GroupID.

- Perpetual membership
- Temporary membership

Modifying the membership of a Smart Group or Dynasty using this commandlet is not recommended, since
your changes will be discarded the next time the group is updated.

GroupID maintains a history for this commandlet, which you can view in GroupID portal, against the
**History** node in the left panel.

## Syntax

```
Add-GroupMember
-GroupIdentity <string>
-Identity <string>
[-Type <string>]
[-StartDate <datetime>]
[-EndDate <datetime>]
[-IdentityStoreId <int>]
[-SecurityToken <CustomClaimsPrincipal>]
[-Credential <pscredential>]
[<CommonParameters>]
```

## Required Parameters

- GroupIdentity
- Identity

Example 1:

The following command adds the user **Brian Regan** to the membership of the **Event Management**
group using the credentials set in the **$Credentials** environment variable. See the
[Set the $Credentials Environment Variable](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/setthecredential.md)
topic for setting credentials in an environment variable.

```
Add-GroupMember -GroupIdentity "CN=Event Management,OU=Local Recruiting,OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -Identity "CN=BrianRegan,CN=User,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -Credential $Cred
```

Example 2:

The following command gets all users from the **Local Recruiting** container and adds them to the
membership of the **Event Management** group. For detailed information about the Get-Object
commandlet, see
[Get-Object](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/membership/getobject.md). The
**OUT-NULL** commandlet is used here to restrict the retrieved users information from appearing on
the console.

```
Get-Object -SearchContainer "OU=Local Recruiting,OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -ObjectType "User" | Add-GroupMember -GroupIdentity "CN=Event Management,OU=Local Recruiting,OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US"
```
