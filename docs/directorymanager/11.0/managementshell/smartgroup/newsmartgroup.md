# New-SmartGroup

This commandlet helps you to create a new Smart Group (managed group) in Directory. A Smart Group is
a conventional distribution or security group that dynamically maintains its membership based on the
rules applied by a user-defined LDAP query.

A Smart Group can also be defined as a Password Expiry group. A Password Expiry group is a dynamic
group whose membership is based on password policy conditions defined by the administrator. The LDAP
query defined for a Smart Group can be updated any time using the
[Set-SmartGroup](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/smartgroup/setsmartgroup.md)
commandlet. When the LDAP query is changed, you must update the group once to modify its membership
according to the changes made to the query. For information about updating a group, see
[Update-Group](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/managementshell/smartgroup/updategroup.md).

You can view events related to this commandlet in GroupID portal, against the **History** node in
the left panel.

container specified by the **OrganizationalUnit** parameter, using the credentials of current user
logged-on to the identity store.

```
New-SmartGroup  -OrganizationalUnit "OU=Recruiting,DC=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -Name "Smart_Training" -GroupAlias "Smart_Training" -MailEnable True -SamAccountName "Smart_Training" -GroupScope "Universal Group" -Type "Distribution"

Example 2:

The following command creates a new universal, distribution Smart Group in the container specified
by the **OrganizationalUnit** parameter and builds its membership by retrieving those objects from
the containers specified in the **SearchContainers** parameter excluding sub-containers that have
**Display Names** matching the Names in a text file.

```
New-SmartGroup -OrganizationalUnit "OU=Recruiting,OU=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -Name "Smart_Enrollment" -SamAccountName "Smart_Enrollment" -GroupScope "Universal Group" -Type "Distribution" -SearchContainers "OU=Recruiting,OU=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US","OU=Outsourcing,OU=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -SearchContainersScopeList "1","1" -LdapFilter "(displayName=Database.[Name])" -DataSourceType "Microsoft Text Driver (*.txt,*.csv)" -FilePath "D:\Inputs\Names.txt" -DataSourceQuery "SELECT [Name] FROM [Names.txt]"
```

The following command creates a new local, distribution, Password Expiry group, using the
credentials set in the **$Credential**s environment variable. Those users will be members of the
group who have passwords aged 20 days or older. Disabled users will also be included in the
membership.

```
New-SmartGroup -OrganizationalUnit "OU=Recruiting,OU=HR,DC=Imanami,DC=US" -Name "Password_Expiry" -GroupAlias "Password_Expiry" -SamAccountName "Password_Expiry" -GroupScope "Domain Local" -Type "Distribution" -IsPasswordExpiryGroup -DomainExpiration 30 -ExpirationRange 10 -IncludeDisabledUsers True -Credential $Cred
