# Hardware Requirements

Minimum hardware requirements for GroupID are:

- 1.4 GHz or faster with four or more cores on a 64-bit processor
- 8 GB of RAM in case of GroupID-managed Elasticsearch

    6 GB of RAM in case of self-managed Elasticsearch

    :::info
    We recommend a dedicated server for GroupID. If you install any other application
    on the GroupID server, adjust RAM requirements accordingly. For example, if you install SQL
    Server, you may need to add 2-4 GB RAM depending on the edition of the SQL Server.
    :::


    Different editions of SQL Server have varying resource requirements. For example:

    - SQL Server Express – Minimal resource usage; 2 GB additional RAM may suffice.
    - SQL Server Standard or Enterprise – These require more resources; allocate 4 GB or more
      additional RAM for optimal performance.

- 6 GB or more disk space (for installation only)

    Space requirements are relative to the provider's data size growth for Elasticsearch data.
