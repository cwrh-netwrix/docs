# Service Account for Active Directory and Exchange

You must have a service account to connect an identity store to an Active Directory domain. GroupID
uses the account to access objects in Active Directory. If Microsoft Exchange is configured as the
messaging provider for the identity store, you can also delegate permissions to this account to
access Exchange objects.

You can use an existing account, provided it has the required permissions, or you can create a new
one. Instructions for both options are discussed in the following sections, although it is
recommended that you create a new service account rather than using an existing account.

:::note
You must add the service account to the membership of the Local Administrator group of the
member server on which GroupID is installed.

and Exchange permissions:

Exchange permissions are required if Microsoft Exchange is configured as the messaging provider for
the identity store.

### Delegate Exchange Permissions to the New Account:

In addition to Active Directory permissions, the service account also needs access permissions for
Exchange, when Exchange is configured as the messaging provider for the identity store.

Instructions for delegating permissions for each supported Exchange Server version are as follows.

**For Exchange Server 2013/2016/2019:**

Launch Exchange Management Shell and type the following command:

```
Add-RoleGroupMember "Recipient Management" -Member domain name\user
```
