# Service Accounts

To connect an Active Directory identity store to a domain, you must use a service account with
elevated privileges. You can also use a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) for this purpose.

See the following topics for details on these accounts:

- [Service Account for Active Directory and Exchange](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/requirements/permissions/adserviceaccount.md)
- [gMSA for Active Directory](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/requirements/permissions/gmsarequirements.md)
