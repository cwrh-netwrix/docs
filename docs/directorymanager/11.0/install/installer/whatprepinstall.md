| Elasticsearch 8.0.0 | If 95% of space is consumed on C drive, Elasticsearch will stop responding intermittently and will require a restart after more than 95% space is available. When Elasticsearch is locked, any object created or modified in GroupID will be committed in provider but not in the Elasticsearch repository. NOTE: While configuring an Elasticsearch cluster on all GroupID Instances, make sure that port TCP IP 9305 or a custom port (configured in the yml file for the Elasticsearch cluster) is unblocked and remains the same on each GroupID instance that is part of the master-slave cluster. NOTE: If you do not want to use this version of Elasticsearch, select the **I will install and manage Elasicsearch myself** option on the Elasticsearch Settings page of the Configuration Tool. |
| Exchange Online Management Module | Required for Microsoft Entra ID |
| WinRM IIS Extension | For GroupID to make a connection to Exchange, configure WinRM in one of the following ways. <ul><li>**Option 1: intra-Domain** Both GroupID and the destination Exchange host must be in the same domain. Both systems must have WinRM configured (use the PowerShell command winrm /quickconfig for this).

Design the hosts to trust each other by configuring “Trusted Hosts” either by GPO or locally.<ul><li>By GPO — Computer > Windows > Admin Templates > Windows Components > Windows Remote Management > WinRM Client > Trusted Hosts</li><li>Use this PowerShell command to configure locally: <pre><code>Set-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts –Value `<servername.domain.com>`</code></pre></li></ul></li></ul> |
