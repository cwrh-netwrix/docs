## Installation Cases

Choose one of the four installation cases for GroupID 11:

- **Case # 1**: GroupIDID 11 to co-exist with GroupID 10 on the same machine

- **Case # 2**: GroupID 11 to co-exist with GroupID 10.0 / 9.0 in the same environment
- **Case # 3**: In-place installation of GroupID 11 on the same machine
- **Case # 4**: In-place installation of GroupID 11 in the environment

The GroupID 11 installation and configuration process is the same for all four cases. You must
create a copy of the database being used with the previous GroupID version and bind the copy with
GroupID 11.

Next, run the Upgrade wizard to make the copied database compatible with GroupID 11. Once upgraded,
the database schema changes, making it incompatible with the previous GroupID version.

:::note
When GroupID 11 co-exists with a previous GroupID version (case # 1 and 2), the two must have
separate databases. Data is not replicated between these databases.

:::note
This section does not apply to a fresh GroupID installation.
