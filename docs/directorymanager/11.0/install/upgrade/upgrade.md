3. From the **Select the previous version to upgrade** list, select the GroupID version to upgrade
   from.

    :::note
    The following steps discuss the upgrade process with GroupID 10 as the source version. The
    process may vary for different source versions.
    :::


4. Click **Next**.

    ![Select modules to upgrade](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/install/upgrade/3-select_modules.webp)

    On the **Select Modules to upgrade** page, select the type of GroupID data for upgrade. You can
    choose to upgrade all or selective data of the previous version. Options are:

    - **Everything** – upgrades all data, which covers all options discussed under Custom.
    - **Custom** – choose what data you want to upgrade. On selecting it, the following options are
      listed, from where you can choose the data to upgrade.

5. Click **Next**.
6. If you have an Microsoft Entra ID based identity store in GroupID 10, the following page appears.

    ![Microsoft Entra ID Store Upgrade page](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/install/upgrade/entraidstore.webp)

    Provide the following information:

    - Registered Client Secret on EntraID: provide the client secret value generated against the
      certificate uploaded to Microsoft Entra Admin Center while registering the GroupID
      application.
    - **PFX Certificate**: Click Browse to navigate to the folder where the certificate is saved.
      This certificate must be the same uploaded for the registered GroupID app in Microsoft Entra
      ID.
    - **PFX Certificate Password**: Provide password of the PFX certificate.

7. Click **Next**.
8. If in the GroupID source version, Office 365 messaging provider is configured in a Microsoft
   Entra ID based identity store or in an AD identity store, the Upgrade wizard displays the
   following page.

    ![ Upgrade wizard Microsoft Entra ID Messaging System page](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/install/upgrade/entraidmessagingsystem.webp)

    Provide the following information:

    - **Client Secret**: provide the client secret value generated against the certificate uploaded
      to Microsoft Entra Admin Center while registering the GroupID application.
    - **PFX Certificate**: Click Browse to navigate to the folder where the certificate is saved.
      This certificate must be the same uploaded for the registered GroupID app in Microsoft Entra
      ID.
    - **PFX Certificate Password**: Provide password of the PFX certificate.

9. If any Synchronize jobs exist in GroupID 10 or the version you are upgrading from, then the
   wizard checks the destination domain set for them. Let's assume you have 5 jobs that connect to
   different child domains in a forest with different service accounts and different messaging
   providers.

    - If an identity store already exists in GroupID 10 for the destination domains that the jobs
      connect to, then jobs are moved to the respective identity stores in GroupID 11.
    - When there is no identity store in GroupID 10 for the destination domain that the jobs connect
      to, the Upgrade wizard reads the FQDN of the destination domains used in the jobs and tries to
      create a forest structure. On identifying one, it proceeds to create an identity store for the
      forest, requiring you to provide a service account. (The user name and password fields will be
      auto populated but you can change them.) All jobs with destination provider for that forest
      domain or any of its child domains will be moved to the new identity store.

        ![synchronize_upgrade](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/install/upgrade/synchronize_upgrade.webp)

        :::note
        The service account you provide here should have at least _read_ permission in the
        entire forest, so that all objects from the forest can be replicated to Elasticsearch.
        :::


        The wizard does not create a separate identity store for each child domain in the same
        forest. In case it cannot determine a forest structure, it creates separate identity stores
        for each domain.

10. For Synchronize jobs that use Office 365 as messaging provider in GroupID 10, the wizard would
    require you to provide the PFX certificate. All Synchronize jobs that use Office 365 as
    messaging provider will be listed on the wizard page. Expand each job and provide the PFX
    certificate along with its password.

    ![Upgrade wizard Synchronize Messaging System page](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/install/upgrade/entraidsynmessagingsystem.webp)

    Provide the following information:

    - **Certificate**: Click Browse to navigate to the folder where the certificate is saved. This
      certificate must be the same uploaded for the registered GroupID app in Microsoft Entra ID.
    - **Password**: Provide password of the PFX certificate.
    - **Client Secret**: provide the client secret value generated against the certificate uploaded
      to Microsoft Entra Admin Center while registering the GroupID application.

11. Click **Next**.
12. In GroupID 10 and earlier versions, reports were generated for the domain that the GroupID
    server was joined to. During upgrade, the wizard checks if an identity store for that domain
    exists or not.

    - If an identity store for that domain exists or if it being created for a Synchronize job in
      this upgrade process, GroupID will bind the reports to it.
    - If an identity store for that domain does not exist, then you have to create an identity store
      for it. It must essentially be an Active Directory identity store. The wizard will bind the
      reports generated in GroupID 10 to the identity store, so you will be able to view them in
      GroupID 11.  
      ![reports_upgrade](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/install/upgrade/reports_upgrade.webp)

    :::note
    If no report has been generated in GroupID 10, the page related to reports upgrade will
    not be displayed.
    :::


13. During upgrade, Synchronize schedules are also moved to identity stores.  
    The Upgrade wizard will check the jobs added to a schedule. If the destination in a job is a
    directory provider, it will automatically move the schedule to the respective identity store.

    :::tip
        Remember, during upgrade, identity stores are created for destination directory providers of
    Synchronize jobs (i.e., for providers that do not have an identity store in the source version).
    :::


    Consider the following:

    - If a schedule has Synchronize jobs where one job uses an Active Directory domain (DomainA) as
      destination and another job uses a file-based provider as destination, then the schedule will
      auto move to the identity store created for DomainA.
    - For schedules with Synchronize jobs that use file-based providers as destination, the Upgrade
      wizard will display the following page that will list all such schedules. Select an identity
      store for each schedule, so that the schedule moves to that identity store.

        ![store_selection_for_schedules](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/install/upgrade/store_selection_for_schedules.webp)

    - The rules stated above also apply to schedules with job collections added to them.

14. Click **Next**.

    ![Summary page](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/install/upgrade/5-summary.webp)

    This page displays a complete summary of the data to be copied/upgraded for your selected
    options. These options were selected on the **Select modules to upgrade** page..

    :::note
    If there are any disabled identity store(s) in the source GroupID version, GroupID will
    not upgrade those identity store(s). However, data of those identity store(s) will remain intact
    in the source GroupID version.
    :::


15. Review the summary and click **Next**.

    ![Upgrade Progress page](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/install/upgrade/6-upgrade_process_complete.webp)

    GroupID is upgraded while the Upgrade Process displays the upgrade progress. On successful
    upgrade, the **Upgradce Completed** message above the progress bar is displayed.

16. Click **Next**.  
    ![Upgrade Completed page](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/install/upgrade/7-upgrade_complete.webp)

    The **Upgrade Completed** page displays the status of features selected for upgrade.

17. You can click:

    - **View Details**: to view log file generated during the Upgrade process.
    - **Launch GroupID**: to start using GroupID 11.
    - **Close**: to close the Upgrade wizard.
