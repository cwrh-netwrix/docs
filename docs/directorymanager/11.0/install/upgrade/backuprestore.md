## GroupID database on SQL Server

Take a backup of the GroupID database that you will use to upgrade to GroupID 11.0.

ldifde -f c:\groupinfobeforedirectorymanager.ldf -r "(&(objectClass=group)(objectCategory=group)(|(extensionData=*)(extensionAttribute15=*)(extensionAttribute14=*)(extensionAttribute13=*)(extensionAttribute12=*)" -p Subtree -l extensionData,extensionAttribute15,extensionAttribute14,extensionAttribute13,extensionAttribute12
