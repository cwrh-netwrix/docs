# Authentication Modes

While setting up GroupID, you must select an authentication mode for connecting to SQL Server (that
hosts the GroupID database). There are two possible modes:

- [Authentication Modes](#authentication-modes)
  - [SQL Server Authentication](#sql-server-authentication)
  - [Windows Authentication](#windows-authentication)

## SQL Server Authentication

It is recommended that you create a new SQL Server account for GroupID. You must add the account to
the _db_creator_ server role so that it can create and maintain the GroupID database.

The account must also be part of the _db_owner_ database role, so that it can execute DDL (Data
Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands. However, unlike Windows
Authentication mode setup, you do not need to add the account to the _db_owner_ role because SQL
Server _db_creator_ is mapped to the _db_owner_ database role by default.

:::note
Note: For SQL Server 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2022 families, every SQL Server account is assigned
the _public_ role. Therefore, the GroupID SQL account belongs to two server roles: _db_creator_ and
_public_.
:::


To add the GroupID SQL account to the db_creator role:

1. Launch SQL Server Management Console.
2. Create a new account for GroupID 11, if needed.
3. Connect to the server using your new GroupID SQL account.
4. Right-click the database server node and click **Properties**.
5. On the **Properties** dialog box, select the **Permissions** page.
6. Scroll down on the **Explicit** tab to the **Connect SQL** permission and select the **Grant**
   check box for it.
7. Click the **Effective** tab. You should have the following permissions listed here:

    - Connect SQL
    - Create any database
    - View any database

8. Click **OK**.

## Windows Authentication

GroupID works with SQL Server (which hosts the GroupID database) using the Windows Authentication
mode in context of the account configured in GroupIDAppPool11 (when SQL Server is available locally
or remotely). GroupID detects this account and authenticates with it on SQL Server via Windows
authentication.

You can configure a domain account in GroupIDAppPool11 and use it to connect GroupID to SQL Server,
provided that it has the following permissions on SQL Server.

- The user account type on SQL Server must be a Windows account with db_owner permissions on the
  GroupID database.
- For creating a new database, the user account must have the db_creator role and db_owner
  permissions on the master database.

Use a domain account when SQL Server is available remotely or locally. A local Windows account will
work only when GroupID and SQL Server are running on the same machine).

The domain account used to connect GroupID with SQL Server must:

- Be a member of the IIS_IUSR and Backup Operators groups.
- Have read/write permissions on the GroupID 11 installation folder: [GroupID installation
  drive]:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID 11.0.
