# Installation

The GroupID installer auto detects the prerequisite software and Windows features that GroupID requires, and installs them without any manual intervention. This has practically simplified GroupID installation, reduced workloads, and diminished installation time.

Furthermore, GroupID configuration and upgrade has been seamlessly integrated into the installation experience.
