PingOne is an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solution that enables organizations to deliver single

Here are the steps to configure single sign-on in GroupID using PingOne as a provider:

- Generate the consumer URL andGroupID metadata file for the GroupID client with which you want to
  configure PingOne.
- Configure GroupID in PingOne.
- Configure the PingOne provider in GroupID.

That done, you can sign into GroupID using PingOne.
