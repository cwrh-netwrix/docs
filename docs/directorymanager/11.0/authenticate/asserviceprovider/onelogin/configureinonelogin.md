# Configure GroupID In OneLogin

Configuring GroupID in OneLogin involve the following steps:

- Create an app for the GroupID portal _Wizard_ in OneLogin.
- Configure this app by specifying the consumer URL and audience URL.
- Specify an attribute for authenticating users who use the OneLogin single sign-on option to log
  into the _Wizard_ portal.
- Define SSO settings.

You also have to:

- Define users in OneLogin, who can authenticate on the _Wizard_ portal using OneLogin.

  GroupID.

## Create an App for GroupID in OneLogin

1. Launch OneLogin.
2. On the Home page, click **New App** to add a new application in the OneLogin control panel.  
   To continue with our example, we will be adding the GroupID portal _Wizard_.
3. The **Find Applications** page is displayed, with a list of already created applications. In the
   **Find Applications** box, type ‘SAML’ to search for single sign-on applications.
4. In the search results, select the **SAML Test Connector (IdP)** option (without any attributes or
   any sign responses).
5. On the **Add SAML Test Connector (IdP)** page, specify a user-friendly name for the application
   in the **Display Name** box.
6. You can also upload an image for the GroupID app that will be displayed on the user dashboard in
   OneLogin.  
   When a user logs into OneLogin, he or she will be redirected to the dashboard that will have
   GroupID and other applications listed for single sign-on.
7. Click **Save**.  
   A message is displayed that the app is added and a few links are displayed under the message.
   Using them, you can specify certain settings for the app.
