# Entitlement Scope Schedule

An Entitlement Scope schedule is automatically created for an identity store when:

- A server is added for permission analysis on the **Entitlement** page in an Active Directory
  identity store. See the
  [Manage File Servers](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/manage.md)
  for additional information on adding a server.

    Or

- A SharePoint site is added for permission analysis on the **Entitlement** page in a Microsoft
  Entra ID identity store. See the
  [Manage SharePoint Sites](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/manage_1.md)
  topic for additional information on adding a SharePoint site.

Using the GroupID portal, users can update the permissions on files and folders residing on file
servers (for Active Directory) and the document libraries in SharePoint sites (for Microsoft Entra
ID). These changes to permissions are instantly committed to the respective file server or site;
however, they are displayed in the GroupID portal after the Entitlement Scope schedule runs.

By default, the schedule runs daily to replicate the permissions from file servers or sites to
Elasticsearch. Permissions are replicated for the target folder, site, or document library and its
sub-trees, till the nth level. Changes made to permissions outside of GroupID are beyond the scope
of this schedule.

Permissions replicated by the Entitlement Scope schedule are also replicated by the
[GroupID Entitlement Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/entitlement.md),
as the latter replicates permissions from scratch. However, the default triggering frequency for the
GroupID Entitlement schedule (i.e., weekly) necessitates a separate Entitlement Scope schedule.

The Entitlement Scope schedule runs in the context of the following accounts:

- For file servers, the schedule runs in the context of the service account defined for the identity
  store. In case you specify a different account for a file server, the schedule runs in the context
  of the changed account. See the
  [Connect to a File Server Using a Different Account](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/manage.md#connect-to-a-file-server-using-a-different-account)
  topic.
- For a SharePoint site, the schedule runs in the context of the account you specified to connect to
  the SharePoint admin site. In case you specify a different account for a site, the schedule runs
  in the context of the changed account. See the
  [Connect to a Site Using a Different Account](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/manage_1.md#connect-to-a-site-using-a-different-account)
  topic.

You cannot create or delete an Entitlement Scope schedule; only edit the existing schedule.

## Update the Entitlement Scope Schedule

Follow the steps to update the Entitlement Scope schedule.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.

Step 2 – On the Identity Stores page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
**Edit**.

Step 3 – Click **Schedules** under Settings in the left pane.

Step 4 – On the Schedules page, click the plus sign next to Entitlement Scope. Then click the
ellipsis button for the schedule and select **Edit**.

Step 5 – On the Edit Schedule page, the Schedule Name and Name Preview boxes display the name of the
schedule as read-only. The name format is
_Entitlement_`<the name of the machine the schedule is created on>`_Scope_.

Step 6 – In the **Scheduler Service Name** drop-down list, select a Scheduler service that would be
responsible for triggering this schedule. The number of services displayed in the list depend on the
number of Elasticsearch clusters in the environment, as each cluster has its own Scheduler service.
See the
[Scheduler Service](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/service/schedulerservice.md)
topic.

Step 7 – The Triggers area displays the default triggering frequency for the schedule.

- To change a trigger, click **Edit** for it.
- To add a new trigger, click **Add Trigger**.

Step 8 – Follow step 11 in the
[Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
topic to manage triggers.

Step 9 – After making the changes, click **Update Schedule**.

Step 10 – On the Schedules page, click **Save**.
