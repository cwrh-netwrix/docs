### Search a Schedule

GroupID enables you to search for a schedule by different attributes, such as job name, job target,
last run time, the kind of notifications set for a job and the user name used for authentication in
a job.

**To apply a filter:**

1. On the **Schedules** page, expand the **Schedule Filters** area by clicking the plus sign.
2. In the _Select a Filter_ box, select an attribute to filter schedules.
3. In the _Select an Operator_ drop-down list, select an operator to apply to the selected
   attribute. This drop-down displays the operators on the basis of the selected attribute.
   Available operators are:

**(missing or bad snippet)**

4. In the _Select a Value_ box, specify a value for the attribute. The selected attribute and
   operator determine the kind of value that can be entered in this box. For some operators, such as
   _Present_ and _Not Present_, this field is not available. These operators check if a value for
   the attribute is present or not.

    **To add more filters** - On adding a filter, the next row is displayed, so you can add another
    filter.  
     **To remove a filter row** - To remove a filter row, click **Remove** for it.
