# Group Life Cycle Schedule

GroupID enables you to define group lifecycle settings for an identity store (see the
[Manage Group Lifecycle Settings](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/grouplifecycle.md)
topic). Based on these settings, the Group Lifecycle schedule expires and logically deletes groups
in the identity store on a scheduled basis, keeping your directory clean and preventing group glut.

While creating a Group Lifecycle schedule, you have to specify a job triggering criterion, the
containers the job will process, and notification options.

The Group Lifecycle schedule performs the following main functions:

- Expires and logically delete groups according to their respective expiry policies (see the
  [ Group Expiry and Deletion](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/groupexpirydeletion.md)
  topic).
- Sends email notifications to relevant personnel before expiring a group. Also initiates
  notifications for group attestation.
- Extends or reduces the life of mail-enabled distribution groups based on their usage.
- Initiates group attestation for expiring groups.

## Create a Group Life Cycle Schedule

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Schedules** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Schedules** page, click **Add Schedule** and select **Group Life Cycle Job**.  
   The **Create Schedule** page is displayed.
5. In the **Schedule Name** box, enter a name for the schedule.
6. The **Name Preview** box displays the schedule name prefixed with _Glm__; the schedule is
   displayed with this name in email notifications.
7. Select a GroupID portal URL in the **Portal URL** drop-down list to include it in notifications
   generated for this schedule. Users are redirected to this portal to perform any necessary action.
8. In the **Scheduler Service Name** drop-down list, select a Scheduler service that would be
   responsible for triggering this schedule. The number of services displayed in the list depend on
   the number of Elasticsearch clusters in the environment, as each cluster has its own Scheduler
   service. See the
   [Scheduler Service](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/service/schedulerservice.md)
   topic.
9. You can specify containers as targets for the schedule. To do so, follow step 9 in the
   [Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
   topic. The schedule will process all groups in the containers and their sub-containers listed in
   the **Target(s)** area in keeping with the Group Lifecycle settings for the identity store.

    NOTE: In Group Lifecycle settings, the administrator can specify container(s) for exclusively
    applying or not applying the Group Life cycle policy. See the
    [Apply Policy on Specific Containers](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/grouplifecycle.md#apply-policy-on-specific-containers)
    topic. With containers specified in the **Target(s)** area, there may be a conflict or
    overlapping of containers, in which case, the Group Lifecycle settings take precedence.

10. Click **Add Triggers** in the **Triggers** area to specify a triggering criterion for the
    schedule, that, when met, starts the execution of the schedule. Follow step 11 in the
    [Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
    topic to manage triggers.
11. Click **Add Authentication** in the **Authentication** area to specify an account for running
    the schedule in the identity store. Follow step 12 in the
    [Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
    topic for details.
12. To set notifications for the schedule, click **Notifications**.

    1. On the **Notifications** dialog box, select the **Send group life extension notification**
       check box to send email notifications to a group’s primary and additional owners when the job
       extends the life of a group, based on group usage settings in the Group Lifecycle policy. For
       group usage settings, see the
       [Enable Group Usage Lifecycle](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/grouplifecycle.md#enable-group-usage-lifecycle)
       topic.
    2. Click **Save**.

13. On the **Create Schedule** page, click **Create Schedule**.
14. On the **Schedules** page, click **Save**.  
    The schedule is displayed under **Group Life Cycle**. See the
    [View the Schedules in an Identity Store ](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/manage.md#view-the-schedules-in-an-identity-store)
    topic for more info.
