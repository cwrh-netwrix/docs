# Managed By Life Cycle Schedule

The Managed By Life Cycle schedule updates the temporary additional owners for groups and temporary
additional managers for users in an identity store. It performs the following functions:

- Group owners and users with the ‘Manage any Group’ permission in the identity store can set a
  start and end date to:

    - Add an object as a temporary additional owner of a group
    - Remove an additional owner for a temporary period

    The Managed By Life Cycle schedule adds and removes an object as a group’s temporary additional
    owner on the specified dates.

- User managers and users with the ‘Manage any Profile’ permission in the identity store can set a
  start and end date to:

    - Add an object (user or contact) as a temporary additional manager of a user
    - Remove an additional manager for a temporary period

    The Managed By Life Cycle schedule adds and removes an object as the user’s temporary additional
    manager on the specified dates.

Let’s assume that the Managed By Life Cycle schedule is scheduled to run once a week, say Mondays.
If an object is to be added as a group’s temporary additional owner for three days - Wednesday till
Friday, it will not be added. This happens because the Managed By Life Cycle schedule did not run on
the specific days for temporary ownership update. Make sure the schedule is set to run at a
frequency that meets your temporary ownership requirements.

GroupID generates notifications when the Managed By Life Cycle schedule adds or removes temporary
additional owners/managers. See the
[Manage Managed by Life Cycle Notifications](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/smtpserver.md#manage-managed-by-life-cycle-notifications)
topic.
