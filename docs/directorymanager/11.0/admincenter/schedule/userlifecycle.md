# User Life Cycle Schedule

The User Life Cycle schedule monitors the profile validation process in GroupID. It performs the
following main functions in keeping with the user profile validation settings for an identity store:

- Monitors the profile validation dates of users
- Generates reminder emails
- Disables users who do not validate their profiles within the given period
