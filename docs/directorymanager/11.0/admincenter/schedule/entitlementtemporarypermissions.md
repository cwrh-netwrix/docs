# Entitlement Temporary Permissions Schedule

An Entitlement Temporary Permissions schedule is automatically created for an identity store when:

- A server is added for permission analysis on the **Entitlement** page in an Active Directory
  identity store. See the
  [Manage File Servers](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/manage.md)
  for additional information on adding a server.

    Or

- A SharePoint site is added for permission analysis on the **Entitlement** page in a Microsoft
  Entra ID identity store. See the
  [Manage SharePoint Sites](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/manage_1.md)
  topic for additional information on adding a SharePoint site.

The Entitlement Temporary Permissions schedule updates the temporary permissions granted to objects
on shared files and folders residing on file servers (for Active Directory), and the document
libraries in SharePoint sites (for Microsoft Entra ID). This is how it works:

- Administrators and other users can set a start and end date to grant certain permission(s)
  temporarily to an object on shared resources, such as file shares and document libraries in a
  SharePoint site.
- They can also set a start and end date to revoke certain permission(s) temporarily for an object
  on shared resources, such as file shares and document libraries in a SharePoint site.
- The Entitlement Temporary Permissions schedule temporarily grants and revokes permissions for an
  object on the specified dates.

Let’s assume that the Entitlement Temporary Permissions schedule is scheduled to run once a week,
say Mondays. If temporary permissions are to be granted to an object on file server share for three
days - Wednesday till Friday, it will not happen. This is because the Entitlement Temporary
Permissions schedule did not run on the specific days for temporary permissions update. Make sure
that the schedule is set to run at a frequency that meets your temporary permission requirements.

The Entitlement Temporary Permissions schedule runs in the context of the following accounts:

- For file servers, the schedule runs in the context of the service account defined for the identity
  store. In case you specify a different account for a file server, the schedule runs in the context
  of the changed account. See the
  [Connect to a File Server Using a Different Account](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/manage.md#connect-to-a-file-server-using-a-different-account)
  topic.
- For a SharePoint site, the schedule runs in the context of the account you specified to connect to
  the SharePoint admin site. In case you specify a different account for a site, the schedule runs
  in the context of the changed account. See the
  [Connect to a Site Using a Different Account](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/manage_1.md#connect-to-a-site-using-a-different-account)
  topic.

You cannot create or delete an Entitlement Temporary Permissions schedule; only edit the existing
schedule.
