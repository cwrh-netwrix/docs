# Workflow Acceleration Schedule

A Workflow Acceleration schedule facilitates the workflow approver acceleration process for workflow
requests. This schedule is auto created when approver acceleration is enabled for the identity
store. See the
[Workflow Approver Acceleration](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/workflow/approveracceleration.md)
topic.

By default, the schedule runs daily to accelerate workflow requests to approvers, according to
workflow acceleration settings for an identity store and some predefined rules for approver
acceleration. It also generates notifications to inform approvers about pending workflow requests.

You cannot create or delete a Workflow Acceleration schedule; only update the existing one.
