# Schema Replication Schedule

An Identity store is built on an identity provider, that could be Active Directory, Microsoft Entra
ID, Google Workspace, or Generic LDAP. The Schema Replication schedule replicates the schema of
these identity providers to the GroupID database.

Unlike other schedules that exist separately for each identity store, GroupID has only one Schema
Replication schedule that serves all identity stores. While the schedule is displayed separately for
each identity store, it does not represent separate schedules. So when you run the Schema
Replication schedule for an identity store, it replicates the schema for all identity stores in
GroupID. And if you terminate it, the process is terminated for all identity stores. Moreover, the
schedule runs every time it is triggered from any of the identity stores, be it manually or
according to its triggers.

When the Schema Replication schedule runs for the first time, it replicates schema from scratch. In
all subsequent runs, it replicates any changes made to the schema. Of this replicated schema, you
can choose the object attributes you actually want to use in an identity store. See the
[Specify Object Attributes to Replicate](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/replication.md#specify-object-attributes-to-replicate)
topic for details.

:::note
For Microsoft Entra ID, schema is replicated from the schema file for Graph API v 3.26.0.
:::


The Schema Replication schedule runs in the context of the super admin account in the GroupID
provider. You cannot create or delete a Schema Replication schedule; only update the existing one.

**What do you want to do?**

- [Update the Schema Replication Schedule](#update-the-schema-replication-schedule)

## Update the Schema Replication Schedule

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Schedules** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Schedules** page, click the plus sign next to **Schema Replication**. Then click the
   ellipsis button for the schedule and select **Edit**.
5. On the **Edit Schedule** page, the **Schedule Name** and **Name Preview** boxes display the name
   of the schedule as read-only.
6. In the **Scheduler Service Name** drop-down list, select a Scheduler service that would be
   responsible for triggering this schedule. The number of services displayed in the list depend on
   the number of Elasticsearch clusters in the environment, as each cluster has its own Scheduler
   service. See the
   [Scheduler Service](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/service/schedulerservice.md)
   topic.

    **CAUTION:** In case of multiple Scheduler services, you must bind the same service with the
    Schema Replication schedules in all the identity stores.

7. The **Triggers** area displays the default triggering frequency for the schedule.

    - To change it, click **Edit** for it.
    - To add a new trigger, click **Add Trigger**.

    Follow step 11 in the
    [Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
    topic to manage triggers.

8. Click **Update Schedule**.
9. On the **Schedules** page, click **Save**.  
   For general schedule info, see the
   [View the Schedules in an Identity StoreÂ ](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/manage.md#view-the-schedules-in-an-identity-store)
