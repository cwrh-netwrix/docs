# Scheduler Service

In GroupID, schedules perform different tasks in an identity store. They run at a specified
frequency to auto execute their respective functions. The Scheduler service is responsible for
triggering these schedules at their respective frequency.

- [Manage Scheduler Service Settings](#manage-scheduler-service-settings)

## View Scheduler Service Details

1. In Admin Center, click **Applications** in the left pane.
2. On the **Applications** page, click the **Scheduler Service** tab.

    The tab displays the default Scheduler service(s) hosted in native IIS. The number of services
    displayed on the tab depend on the number of Elasticsearch clusters in your environment, as each
    cluster has its own Scheduler service. See the
    [Elasticsearch Clusters, Nodes, and GroupID](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/service/overview.md#elasticsearch-clusters-nodes-and-groupid)
    topic.  
    For details displayed on a service card, see the table in the
    [View Data Service Details](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/service/dataservice/manage.md#view-data-service-details)
    topic.

    You cannot create a new Scheduler service or delete the existing one
