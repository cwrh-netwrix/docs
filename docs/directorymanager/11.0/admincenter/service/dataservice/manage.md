# Manage Data Service Settings

Data services in GroupID are displayed on the **Data Service** tab. A card for a service displays
information such as its name and status.

You can manage several settings for a service, such as:

- Change the display name of a service
- Start or stop a service
- Configure file logging for a service
- Delete a service

## View Data Service Details

1. In Admin Center, click **Applications** in the left pane.
2. On the **Applications** page, click the **Data Service** tab. The **Data Service** tab page is
   displayed, that lists the default Data service created while configuring GroupID and any other
   Data service that you have created.  
   When multiple GroupID instances have been deployed, you will find multiple default Data services
   on this tab page, as each instance has its own default Data service. See the
   [Elasticsearch Clusters, Nodes, and GroupID](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/service/overview.md#elasticsearch-clusters-nodes-and-groupid)
   topic.
3. The card for a Data service displays the following information:

    | Status               | A service has one of the following statuses: - **Running:** Indicates that the service is up and running. - **Stopped:** Indicates that GroupID is unable to communicate with the service. To troubleshoot, go to the web server where the service is deployed (IIS, remote IIS, or Docker) and make sure the service is running. - **Error:** Any issue other than _stopped_ is categorized as _error_. Contact your system administrator to resolve it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
    | Launch Application   | Click it to launch the service page. - For a Data service, Replication service, Email service, and Scheduler service, a page is displayed that simply shows the status of the service as _running_, _stopped_, or _error_. - For a Security service, the **GroupID Applications** page is displayed. Performing an action on this page will be carried out through the respective Security service. See the [Access your Applications](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/concepts/accessapplications.md) topic. - For Admin Center, this link launches the Admin Center application. - For Mobile service, it launches the **GroupIDMobileService** page that enables users to configure the GroupID mobile app on a phone. |
    | Ellipsis             | Click it to launch a shortcut menu with the following options: - **Settings:** launches the service settings page, where you can manage deployment settings and log settings. - **Delete:** deletes the service. This option is not available for the default services. For Mobile service, this shortcut menu also displays the following options: - **Deploy Another Instance:** enables you to deploy another instance of the service. - **Copy:** enables you to create a new Mobile service by copying the settings of this service.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
