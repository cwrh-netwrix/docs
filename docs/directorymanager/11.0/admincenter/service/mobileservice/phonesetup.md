# Install and Configure the GroupID App

To use the GroupID app on a smartphone, users must do the following:

- Install the GroupID app on their smartphone
- Connect it to the GroupID server

## Install the App

The Android, Windows, and iOS versions of the GroupID mobile app have been published on Google Play,
Windows Store, and App Store respectively.

1. Go to the relevant store on your smartphone and search for **Imanami GroupID**.
2. Install the app and launch it on your phone.

## Configure the App

The GroupID app uses the Mobile service to communicate with the GroupID server. Mobile service can
be hosted on any of these three web servers: native IIS, remote IIS, and Docker.

To connect the app to the GroupID server, you must register the URL of the web server that hosts the
Mobile service in the app. Choose any of the following methods to do so:

- Enter the web server URL manually in the app, or
- Scan a QR code with your phone.

:::note
Since you can have multiple Mobile services as well as multiple instances of the same service,
the administrator should provide the URL or QR code of the specific service or instance that they
want users to configure the app with.

### Manually Provide the Web Server URL

The web server URL for a Mobile service or an instance of a service is displayed on the
**GroupIDMobileService** page (see the
[Launch a Mobile Service or a Service Instance](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/service/mobileservice/create.md#launch-a-mobile-service-or-a-service-instance)
topic). Provide it to your users to enable them to configure the app.

**To get the URL of the page that displays the web server URL:**

1. Launch the required Mobile service or its instance. (See the
   [Launch a Mobile Service or a Service Instance](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/service/mobileservice/create.md#launch-a-mobile-service-or-a-service-instance)
   topic.)
2. Copy the URL of the **GroupIDMobileService** page and provide it to your users, so they can open
   this page in a web browser.

**To enter the web server URL in the app:**

1. When you launch the GroupID app on your smartphone for the first time, the **Configure** page is
   displayed. Tap **Configure Application Manually**.
2. Copy the web server URL displayed on the GroupIDMobileService page and enter it in the **GroupID
   Server URL** box in the app.
3. Tap **Save and Proceed**.  
   The app validates the URL and on success, the **Login** page is displayed. Sign into the app and
   start using it.

### Scan the QR Code

The QR code is an easy way to configure the GroupID app. Provide the QR code of a Mobile aervice or
an instance of a service to users, so they can scan it to connect the app with the respective
service.

**To get the URL of the page that displays the QR code:**

1. Launch the required Mobile service or its instance. (See the
   [Launch a Mobile Service or a Service Instance](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/service/mobileservice/create.md#launch-a-mobile-service-or-a-service-instance)
   topic.)
2. Copy the URL of the **GroupIDMobileService** page and provide it to your users, so they can open
   this page in a web browser.

**To configure the app with QR code:**

1. Launch the **GroupIDMobileService** page with the given URL.
2. Launch the GroupID app on your smartphone and tap **Configure Application using QR Code** on the
   **Configure** page.
