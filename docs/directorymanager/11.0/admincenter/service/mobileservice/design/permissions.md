# Grant Permissions to Security Roles

In GroupID, three security roles are defined by default in an identity store: Administrator,
Helpdesk, and User. More security roles can be added as required.

:::note
In a Microsoft Entra ID identity store, the Helpdesk role is not available by default.
:::


You can grant permissions on the GroupID app to security roles that exist in an identity store
associated with a Mobile service, so that role members can access the allowed features only.
