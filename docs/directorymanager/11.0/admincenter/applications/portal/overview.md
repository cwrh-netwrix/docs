# GroupID Portal

A GroupID portal represents a virtual link with the directory. Using it, users can do the following
in an identity store:

- Search the directory.
- Perform group management tasks, such as create and update their groups; join and leave groups;
  attest, expire and renew groups, and more.
- Carry out user management tasks, such as create, update, and delete users in the directory. Users
  can maintain and update their profiles, change their passwords, manage their accounts, manage
  their direct reports, and more.
- Synchronize data between a source and a destination, such as directories, files, and databases.
- Manage user and group entitlements to shared resources on file servers and SharePoint sites.
- Approve and deny workflow requests.
- Generate hundreds of insightful reports on Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID, Exchange, and
  Office 365 objects (groups, users, mailboxes, contacts, computers, and servers).
- View history data for directory objects that are created, updated, or deleted in the directory
  using GroupID.

Delegating group and user management tasks to end-users reduces the workload on IT administrators
and helpdesk, as users are empowered to manage their groups and direct reports without assistance
from an administrator. Moreover, when users maintain and update their profile information, data is
more accurate and reliable.

Administrators can maintain complete control over data integrity, as they can implement fine-grained
controls and policies that determine what users can view and change using the GroupID portal. They
can also define workflows for an identity store, that serve as a built-in auditing system to ensure
that users enter correct data before changes are committed to the directory.

A GroupID portal can be linked with multiple identity stores, thus eliminating the need to create a
separate portal for each identity store. Users can select an identity store while signing in.

## Linked Identity Stores and the GroupID Portal

The administrator can link two or more identity stores in GroupID. As a prerequisite for linking,
the identity stores must be built on Active Directory or Microsoft Entra ID domains. The purpose is
to link identical objects in different domains.

To learn about linked identity stores and how they work in a GroupID portal, see the
[Linked Identity Stores and the GroupID Portal](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/link/overview.md#linked-identity-stores-and-the-groupid-portal)
topic.

## Notifications in the Portal

A GroupID portal can send email notifications to designated recipients when a user makes a change to
objects in an identity store. To specify notification recipients, see the
[Specify Notification Recipients](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/smtpserver.md#specify-notification-recipients)
topic.

By default, notifications are sent to users in the English language. However, a user can opt to
receive notifications in a supported language by personalizing the language settings from the
**Settings** panel in the portal.
