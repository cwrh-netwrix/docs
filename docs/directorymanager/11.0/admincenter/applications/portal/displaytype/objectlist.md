# Specify Attributes for Object List View

In the portal, the object list refers to a listing of groups that are similar to another group,
Group similarity is measured on the basis of group type and membership.

Let’s assume you want to view the groups that are similar to Group A. On the **Similar Groups** tab
in Group A’s properties, six groups that bear the most similarity to Group A will be displayed, with
the strongest match at the top. It is as:

![similar_groups](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/portal/design/similar_groups.webp)

For a similar group, three attributes are displayed:

- Attribute 1 - The group’s display name. This attribute cannot be changed.
- Attribute 2 - You can specify any attribute. The default attribute is _mail_.
- Attribute 3 - You can specify any attribute. The default attribute is _expiration policy_.
