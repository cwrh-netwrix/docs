# Customize Properties Pages

GroupID enables you to customize the property pages displayed in the portal for these directory
objects:

- User
- Group
- Smart Group
- Parent Dynasty
- Middle Dynasty
- Leaf Dynasty
- Mailbox
- Contact
- Computer (Only available for adding to group memberships in the portal. Its properties are
  read-only.)

NOTE: A Microsoft Entra ID identity store does not support the _computer_ and _contact_ object
types.

In the GroupID portal, the properties page of an object has multiple tabs, where each tab groups
similar attributes. These tabs are referred to as categories.

You can customize the following:

**For a tab:**

- Add a new tab (category) to an object’s properties page
- Update the details for a tab
- Remove a tab from an object’s properties page

**For a field on a tab:**

- Add a field to a tab
- Update the details for a field
- Rearrange the fields on a tab
- Remove a field from a tab

## Add a Tab (Category)

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to customize the portal for it.  
   All identity stores linked with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can design a
   different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Properties** in the left pane; the **Properties** page is displayed.
5. In the **Select Directory Object** list, select a directory object to add a tab to its properties
   page.  
   The **Name** list displays the tabs (categories) currently available on the object’s properties
   page.
6. Click **Add**. The **Add Design Category** pane is displayed.
7. Enter a name for the tab in the **Name** box. The tab will be displayed on the object’s
   properties page with this name.
8. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The tab would be visible to
   users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. The tab would not be
   visible to group owners (for their respective groups) and user managers (for their direct
   reports) if they fall in a lower priority role. See
   [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/manage.md).

    - Select _Never_ to hide the tab from all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the tab visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
      manager (in case of a user or contact). It would be hidden from other users, such as group
      members or a user. For example:

        - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Email_ tab in group properties, the tab would
          be visible to group owners for their respective groups in the portal.
        - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Account_ tab in user properties, the tab would
          be visible to managers for their respective direct reports in the portal.

    - If you have selected ‘User’ or ‘Mailbox’ in the **Select Directory Object** drop-down list,
      the _Self_ option is also available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_
      to make the tab visible to the respective user or mailbox. It would be hidden from other
      users, such as the user’s manager. For example, if the _Self_ role is selected for the
      _General_ tab in user properties, it means that:

        - A user can view the General tab on his or her properties page. He or she cannot view this
          tab on the properties page of another user.
        - A role with a higher priority value cannot see it for another user.
        - User managers cannot view it for their direct reports.
        - A role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot view it for
          other users.

9. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles with
   a priority value higher than it can add and update the values of fields on this tab. If group
   owners/user managers fall in a lower priority role, they cannot update the fields on the tab for
   their respective groups/direct reports. See
   [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/manage.md).

    - Select _Never_ to make the tab and its fields read-only for all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case of a
      user or contact) to specify or modify the value of the fields on the tab. It would be
      read-only for other users, such as group members or the respective user. For example, if
      _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Email_ tab in group properties, it means that:

        - Only group owners can specify or modify the values of fields on this tab for their
          respective groups in the portal.
        - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update field values.
        - Group members cannot specify or update field values.
        - A role with the ‘Manage any Group’ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
          update field values.

    - If you have selected ‘User’ or ‘Mailbox’ in the **Select Directory Object** list, the _Self_
      option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list.  
      Select _Self_ to enable the respective user or mailbox to specify or modify the value of the
      fields on the tab. The tab would be read-only for the user’s manager and other users. For
      example, if _Self_ is selected for the _General_ tab in user properties, it means that:

        - Only the user can add and update the values of fields on the General tab of his or her
          properties page.
        - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update field values.
        - The user’s manager cannot specify or update field values.
        - A role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
          update field values.

10. To add fields to the tab, see the [Add a Field to a Tab](#add-a-field-to-a-tab) topic.
11. Click **OK**.
12. Click **Save** on the **Properties** page.

7. On the **Edit Design Category** pane, click **Add Field**; the **Add Field** pane is displayed.
8. In the **Field** drop-down list, select a schema attribute to link to this field.  
   Updating the field in the portal is akin to updating the value of this attribute.
9. In the **Display Name** box, enter a display name for the field. This name is the field’s label
   on the tab.
10. In the **Display Type** drop-down list, select the display type to use for rendering this field
    on the tab.  
    The list contains basic display types and custom display types defined on the **Custom Display
    Types** page. See the
    [Display Type Categories](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/categories/categories.md)
    topic.
11. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The tab would be visible to
    users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. It would not be
    visible to group owners (for their respective groups) and user managers (for their direct
    reports) if they fall under a lower priority role. See
    [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/manage.md).

    - Select _Never_ to hide the field from all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the field visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
      manager (in case of a user or contact). It would be hidden from other users, such as group
      members or a user. For example:

        - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Expiration Date_ field on the _General_ tab in
          group properties, the field would be visible to group owners for their respective groups
          in the portal.
        - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Manager_ field on the _Organization_ tab in
          user properties, the field would be visible to managers for their direct reports in the
          portal.

    - If you have selected ‘User’ or ‘Mailbox’ in the **Select Directory Object** drop-down list,
      the _Self_ option is also available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_
      to make the field visible to the respective user or mailbox. It would be hidden from other
      users, such as the user’s manager. For example, if _Self_ is selected for the _Notes_ field on
      the _Phone/Notes_ tab in user properties, it means that:

        - A user can view the field on his or her properties page only. He or she cannot see this
          field on the properties page of another user.
        - A role with a higher priority value cannot view it for another user.
        - User managers cannot view it for their direct reports.
        - A role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot view it for
          other users.

12. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles
    with a priority value higher than this role can add and update the value of this field. If group
    owners/user managers fall in a lower priority role, they cannot able to update the value of the
    field for their respective groups/direct reports. See
    [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/manage.md).

    - Select _Never_ to make this field read-only for all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable only the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case
      of a user or contact) to specify or modify the value of this field. It would be read-only for
      other users, such as group members or the respective user. For example, if _Manager and Owner_
      is selected for the _Expiration Date_ field on the _General_ tab in group properties, it means
      that:

        - Only group owners can specify or modify the value of this field for their groups in the
          portal.
        - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update the field value.
        - Group members cannot specify or update the field value.
        - A role with the ‘Manage any Group’ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
          update the field value.

    - If you have selected ‘User’ or ‘Mailbox’ in the **Select Directory Object** list, the _Self_
      option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_ to enable the
      respective user or mailbox to specify or modify the value of the field. The field would be
      read-only for other users, such as the user’s manager or a role with a higher priority value.
      For example, if _Self_ is selected for the _Notes_ field on the _Phone / Notes_ tab in user
      properties, it means that:

        - Only the respective user can add and update the value of this field on the _Phone / Notes_
          tab in his or her properties page.
        - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update the field value.
        - The user’s manager cannot specify or update the field value.
        - A role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
          update the field values.

13. Click **Advanced Options** to display additional fields.
14. As mentioned for visibility level and access level, the field is visible and editable for
    members of the selected role and roles with a priority value higher than it.  
    In the **Exclude Roles** area, select the check boxes for the higher priority role(s) to deny
    them access and visibility on the field.
15. In the **Tooltip Text** box, enter the text to display when a user hovers the mouse over the
    field.
16. In the **Max Length** box, enter a number that represents the maximum number of characters that
    users can enter as value for this field.  
    Entering _0_ indicates that users can enter an unlimited number of characters as value.
17. Use the **Search Object Types** area to specify the object types (User, Contact, and/or Group)
    that can be searched on the portal’s _Find_ dialog box, to set as value for the field.  
    The following display types support the **Find** dialog box:

    - DN
    - DNs
    - Custom display types created with the Grid type

    When you select any of these display types, GroupID identifies that the value for the field has
    to be searched and selected using the _Find_ dialog box. The **Search Object Types** area is
    displayed, where you can select the required object type(s). For example, if you select _Group_,
    only groups can be searched and selected as value for the field.  
    You can launch the _Find_ dialog box from multiple portal pages to search for objects to
    designate as owners, managers, additional owners, members, and more. While specifying the
    searchable object type(s), you must be aware of the kind of value the field requires.

18. Select the **Is Required** check box to make it mandatory for users to provide a value for the
    field.
19. Select the **Is Read Only** check box to make the field read-only.
20. Select the **Filter Bad Words** check box to ensure that users do not enter any bad word in this
    field.  
    A value entered for the field is checked against the words listed on the **Bad Words List**
    page. Matched values cannot be saved. See the
    [Manage the Bad Words List](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/displaytype/badwords.md)
    topic.
21. The **Image Attribute** list is available when ‘DN’ is selected as the display type. This list
    supports ‘thumbnailPhoto’ as its value.

    - Select the ‘thumbnailPhoto’ attribute in the **Image Attribute** drop-down list when you want
      to auto upload an image for the field. Let’s assume you apply this setting for the Primary
      Manager field in group properties. In the portal, the primary manager's image will be
      displayed alongside his or her name on the group properties page.  
      Note that for the image to display, the ‘thumbnailPhoto’ attribute must have a value stored;
      in case of no value, an image placeholder is displayed.
    - If you do not want to auto upload an image for the field, clear the value in the **Image
      Attribute** box.

22. Click **OK**.  
    The field is displayed in the **Fields** area on the **Edit Design Category** pane. You can
    rearrange the fields, update field details, and even remove a field from the tab.
23. Click **OK**.
24. Click **Save** on the **Properties** page.
