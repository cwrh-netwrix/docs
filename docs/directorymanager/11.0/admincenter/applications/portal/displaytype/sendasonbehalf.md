# The ‘Send on Behalf’ and ‘Send As’ Permissions

Using the portal, a user can delegate the _Send on Behalf_ and _Send As_ permissions to other
objects.

### The Send on Behalf Permission

The _Send on Behalf_ permission in Microsoft Exchange and Office 365 allows a user to send an email
as another user, while showing the recipient that it was sent from a user on behalf of another user.

For example, when User A grants Send on Behalf permissions to User B, then User B can send email on
behalf of User A. User B will be able to choose User A’s email address in the ‘From’ field when
composing a message in Outlook. Message recipients will see both User A’s address and User B’s
address, as the ‘From’ address will read as:

_From: Mailbox `<User B's address>` on behalf of Mailbox `<User A’s address>`._

### The Send As Permission

The _Send As_ permission in Microsoft Exchange and Office 365 enables a user to send a message as
another user. For example, when User A grants _Send As_ permissions to User B, User B will be able
to choose User A’s email address in the ‘From’ field when composing a message in Outlook. This
message, while sent by User B, will appear as sent by User A.

### Prerequisites for the Send As and Send on Behalf Permissions

In the following content, a ‘target object’ refers to the object that can add other objects to its
Send As and Send on Behalf lists using the portal.

- The target object can be a mailbox or a mail-enabled group.
- Microsoft Exchange or Office 365 must be configured as the messaging provider for the identity
  store.
- An SMTP server must be configured for the identity store.
- The user logged in the portal must have the “Manage any Profile” permission for its respective
  role in the identity store.
- The XAdPermissionExtendedRights attribute should be available for Send As and the publicDelegates
  attribute should be available for Send on Behalf.
- The ExchangeTrustedsubsystem object should have modify permissions on the target objects in Active
  Directory for the Send As permission to be set using the portal. For more information, see
  [Access denied when you try to give user "send-as" or "receive as" permission for a Distribution Group in Exchange Server](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/access-denied-when-you-try-to-give-user-send-as-or-receive-as-permission-for-a-distribution-group-in-exchange-server-505822f4-8dca-7b97-d378-c8416553f6d2).

## Set up the Send As Feature

You can provide the Send As setting on any tab of an object’s properties page in the portal. This
would enable the object to delegate the Send As permission to users.

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to customize the portal for it.  
   All identity stores linked with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can design a
   different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Properties** in the left pane. The **Properties** page is displayed.
5. In the **Select Directory Object** drop-down list, select a Mailbox or Group object to add the
   Send As setting to its properties page. The **Name** list displays the tabs on the object’s
   properties page.
6. Click **Edit** for a tab (for example, the **Email** tab).  
   The **Edit Design Category** pane is displayed, with the **Fields** area displaying the fields on
   the tab.
7. Click **Add Field** to add the **Send As** field. The **Add Field** pane is displayed.
8. In the **Field** drop-down list, select the _XAdPermissionExtendedRights_ attribute.
9. In the **Display Name** box, provide a label for the field, such as ‘Send As Permissions’. The
   Send As field will be displayed with this name in the portal.
10. In the **Display Type** drop-down list, select ‘DNs’.
11. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The Send As field would be
    visible to users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. It would
    not even be visible to group owners (for their respective groups) and user managers (for their
    direct reports) if they fall in a lower priority role. See
    [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/manage.md).

    - Select _Never_ to hide the field from all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the field visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
      manager (in case of a mailbox). It would be hidden from other users, such as group members or
      the mailbox itself. In other words, the field would be visible to group owners for their
      respective groups and to managers for their respective direct reports in the portal.
    - If you have selected ‘Mailbox’ in the Select Directory Object list, the _Self_ option is also
      available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_ to make the field visible
      only to the mailbox on his or her properties page. It would not be visible to any other user,
      such as a role with a higher priority value or a role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission
      in the identity store.

12. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles
    with a priority value higher than this role can add and update the value of the Send As field,
    i.e., add and remove objects in the Send As list. If group owners/user managers fall in a lower
    priority role, they would not be able to update the value of the field for their respective
    groups/direct reports.

    - Select _Never_ to make the field read-only for all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable only the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case
      of a mailbox) to specify or modify the value of this field. It would be read-only for other
      users, such as group members or the mailbox itself.  
      In other words, only group owners can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective groups in the portal. A role with a higher priority value cannot change the value;
      group members cannot change the value; and even a role with the ‘Manage any Group’ permission
      in the identity store cannot change the value.  
      Similarly, only mailbox managers can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective direct reports in the portal. A role with a higher priority value cannot change the
      value; and even a role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot
      change the value.
    - If you have selected ‘Mailbox’ in the Select Directory Object drop-down list, the _Self_
      option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list. Select **Self** to enable the
      mailbox to specify or modify the value of the field. It would be read-only for other users,
      such as the mailbox’s manager or a role with a higher priority value or even a role with the
      ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store.

13. As mentioned for access level and visibility level, the field is editable and visible to members
    of the selected role and roles with a priority value higher than the selected role.  
    In the **Exclude Roles** area, select the check boxes for the higher priority role(s) to deny
    them access and visibility on the field.
14. Use the **Search Object Types** area to specify the object types that can be searched on the
    portal’s Find dialog box, to set as value for the _Send As_ field.  
    The following display types support the Find dialog box:

    - DN
    - DNs
    - Custom display types created with the Grid type

    When you select any of these display types, GroupID identifies that the value for the _Send As_
    field has to be searched using the Find dialog box. The **Search Object Types** area is
    displayed, where you can select the required object type(s). For example, if you select User,
    only user objects can be searched and selected as value for the field.

15. Select the **Is Required** check box to make it mandatory for users to add at least one object
    to the _Send As_ list.
16. Select the **Is Read Only** check box to make the _Send As_ field read-only.
17. Click **OK** on the **Add Field** pane and the **Edit Design Category** pane.
18. Click **Save** on the **Properties** page.

#### The Send As Field in the Portal

Launch the portal and go to the properties of the target object (group or mailbox) you defined the
Send As field for, then click the respective tab. The Send As field is displayed as follows:

![sendas](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/portal/design/sendas.webp)

Use the **Add** and **Remove** buttons to add and remove objects in the Send As list. The added
objects can send email for the target object in accordance with the Send As functionality.

## Set up the Send on Behalf Feature

You can provide the Send on Behalf setting on any tab of an object’s properties page in the portal.

   All identity stores linked with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can design a
   different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Properties** in the left pane. The **Properties** page is displayed.
5. In the **Select Directory Object** list, select a Mailbox or Group object to add the Send on
   Behalf setting to its properties page. The **Name** list displays the tabs on the object’s
   properties page.
6. Click **Edit** for a tab (for example, the **Email** tab).  
   The **Edit Design Category** pane is displayed, with the **Fields** area displaying the fields on
   the tab.
7. Click **Add Field** to add the **Send on Behalf** field. The **Add Field** pane is displayed.
8. In the **Field** drop-down list, select the _publicDelegates_ attribute.
9. In the **Display Name** provide a label for the field, such as ‘Send on Behalf Permissions’. The
   Send on Behalf field will be displayed with this name on the portal.
10. In the **Display Type** drop-down list, select ‘DNs’.
11. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The Send on Behalf field
    would be visible to users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. It
    would not be visible to group owners (for their groups) and user managers (for their direct
    reports) if they fall in a lower priority role. See
    [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/manage.md).

    - Select _Never_ to hide the field from all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the field visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
      manager (in case of a mailbox). It would be hidden from other users, such as group members or
      the mailbox itself. In other words, the field would be visible to group owners for their
      respective groups and to managers for their respective direct reports in the portal.
    - If you have selected ‘Mailbox’ in the Select Directory Object list, the _Self_ option is also
      available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_ to make the field visible
      only to the mailbox on his or her properties page. It would not be visible to any other user,
      such as a role with a higher priority value or a role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission
      in the identity store.

12. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles
    with a priority value higher than this role can add and update the value of the Send on Behalf
    field, i.e., add and remove objects in the Send on Behalf list. If group owners/user managers
    fall in a lower priority role, they would not be able to update the value of the field for their
    respective groups/direct reports.

    - Select _Never_ to make the field read-only for all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable only the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case
      of a mailbox) to specify or modify the value of this field. It would be read-only for other
      users, such as group members or the mailbox itself.  
      In other words, only group owners can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective groups in the portal. A role with a higher priority value, group members, or a role
      with the ‘Manage any Group’ permission in the identity store cannot change the value.  
      Similarly, only mailbox managers can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective direct reports in the portal. A role with a higher priority value or a role with
      the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot change the value.
    - If you have selected ‘Mailbox’ in the _Select Directory Object_ drop-down list, the _Self_
      option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list. Select **Self** to enable the
      mailbox to specify or modify the value of the field. It would be read-only for other users,
      such as the mailbox’s manager or a role with a higher priority value or even a role with the
      ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store.

13. As mentioned for access level and visibility level, the field is editable and visible to members
    of the selected role and roles with a priority value higher than the selected role.  
    In the **Exclude Roles** area, select the check boxes for the higher priority role(s) to deny
    them access and visibility on the field.
14. Use the **Search Object Types** area to specify the object types that can be searched on the
    portal’s Find dialog box, to set as value for the _Send on Behalf_ field.  
    The following display types support the Find dialog box:

    - DN
    - DNs
