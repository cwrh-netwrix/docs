# Specify Attributes for Import/Export of Group Owners and Members

In the GroupID portal, users can:

- Export members and additional owners of a group to a file, such as a csv or an xls file
- Import members and additional owners for a group from a file. Members can also be imported from an
  external data source.

You can specify schema attributes to be used for export/import, along with a user-friendly name for
each attribute.

- The import function reads the objectsâ€™ information from an external file or data source and
  searches for matching objects in the directory based on field mapping (where a column name in the
  file or data source is mapped to any of the attributes specified here).  
  Objects having the same values for the mapped fields are added to the membership or additional
  ownership of the target group.
- The export function reads the membership/additional ownership of the group and exports the values
  of the specified attributes for members/additional owners to an external file.

The schema attributes you specify are displayed with their user-friendly names on the following
wizards in the portal:

| Wizard Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
