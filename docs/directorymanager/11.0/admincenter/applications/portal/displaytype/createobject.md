# Customize the Create Object Wizards

Using a portal, users can create different directory objects, namely:

- User
- Mailbox
- Contact
- Static Group
- Smart Group
- Organizational Dynasty
- Geographical Dynasty
- Managerial Dynasty
- Custom Dynasty

The portal provides a separate wizard for creating each of these objects. You can customize a wizard
as needed.

:::note
In the portal, the _Create Group_ wizard starts with the _Group Type_ page, where users can
select the type of group they want to create. Options on this page vary, depending on the
permissions assigned to the user in the identity store. (See the
[Security Role – Permissions](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/permissions.md)
topic.)
:::


- If a user has the _Create Static Group_ permission and is denied the _Create Smart Group_
  permission, only the _Static Group_ option is displayed on the _Group Type_ page.
- If a user has the _Create Smart Group_ permission and is denied the _Create Static Group_
  permission, all options except _Static Group_ are displayed on the _Group Type_ page.

:::note
You can customize the _Group Type_ page individually for static group, Smart Group, and each
of the Dynasty types. However:
:::


- If a user has permissions to create both static groups and Smart Groups, the _Group Type_ page
  created for _Static Group_ would be displayed to the user in the portal.
- If a user does not have permission to create static groups, but has permission to create Smart
  Groups, the _Group Type_ page created for _Smart Group_ would be displayed to the user in the
  portal for Smart Groups and Dynasties.
