# Customize Search Forms

You can customize the search forms for a portal. You can:

- Add new fields
- Edit existing fields
- Remove fields
- Change the arrangement of fields on a page

NOTE: You can only customize existing search forms; you cannot add new ones.

### Customizable Search Forms

The following table lists the search forms that you can customize:

| Search Form Name | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default          | Manage the search fields on the _Advanced Search_ page, where users can search directory objects (user, group, contact) by different attributes. This page is displayed when users click the _Advanced Search_ link.                                                                                                                |
| Find Dialog      | Manage the search fields on the _Find_ dialog box. The _Find_ dialog box can be launched from various portal pages, for example, from the **Owner** tab, **Members** tab, and **Member Of** tab in group properties. It is used to search for objects to designate as owners, managers, additional owners, group members, and more. |
