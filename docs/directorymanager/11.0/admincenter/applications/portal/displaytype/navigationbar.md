# Customize the Navigation Bar

The left navigation bar in a portal lists nodes that enable users to navigate in the portal: These
nodes are:

- Create New
- Dashboard
- Groups
- Users
- Requests
- History
- Entitlement
- Synchronize
- Reports

On expanding a node, its sub-nodes are displayed. On clicking a sub-node, users are redirected to a
page that contains tabs under that sub-node. It is as:

![navigation_bar](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/portal/design/navigation_bar.webp)

GroupID enables you to customize the nodes, sub-nodes, and their respective tabs.
