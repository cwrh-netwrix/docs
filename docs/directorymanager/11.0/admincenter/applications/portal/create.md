# Create a GroupID Portal

Admin Center lets you quickly build and deploy web-based portals for end-users to carry out user,
group, and entitlement management tasks. Users can also view detailed reports on the current state
and health of the directory.

You can create multiple GroupID portals as well as create multiple instances for a portal.

## Host a Portal

A portal is hosted on a web server, with native IIS, remote IIS, and Docker as the supported
servers.

- **IIS deployment** - Your GroupID portal is hosted within a site in IIS. To launch IIS,
  see [Opening IIS Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/iis/6.0-sdk/ms525920(v=vs.90)).

    ![in_iis](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/portal/in_iis.webp)

- **Docker deployment** - For a Docker deployment, make sure you have a running instance of Docker
  daemon in your environment. A portal runs within a container in Docker.

## Deploy Multiple Instances of a Portal

For load balancing and high availability, GroupID facilitates you to create multiple GroupID
portals, and even create multiple instances of the same portal. You may host different instances on
different web servers. For example, you can create two instances of a portal while hosting one in
native IIS and another in remote IIS.

Multiple instances of a portal share the same design settings and the same server settings, except
that each instance has its own deployment settings. A change to the shared settings propagates to
all deployment instances.

As multiple Data services and Security services can be created in GroupID, you can bind a different
Data service and Security service with each deployment instance of a portal. In this way, different
instances use different services for improved response times and load balancing.

## Create a Portal in Native IIS

When you create a portal in native IIS, GroupID does the following:

- It creates a directory with the portal’s name at the following physical path on the GroupID
  server, and copies the portal files from its template directory to the new portal directory:  
  X:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID 11.0\GroupIDPortal\Inetpub\  
  (X represents the GroupID installation drive)
- It also creates a virtual directory for the portal in your desired IIS site.

The portal runs within a virtual directory in native IIS while the portal files are physically
located on disk.

**To create a portal:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Applications** in the left pane.
2. Click **Add Application**.
3. On the next page, select **GroupID Portal** and click **Next step**.
4. On the **Create GroupID Application** page, make sure the **IIS** tile is selected.
5. In the **Application Name** box, enter a unique name for the portal or use the default name. The
   portal is displayed with this name in GroupID.
6. In the **Deployment Name** box, enter a deployment name for the portal. This name is used to
   indicate the deployment instance for the portal in GroupID.  
   A portal can have multiple deployments, for example, one in IIS and another in Docker.  
   The application name and deployment name are displayed on the portal card on the **GroupID
   Portal** tab.

    ![portal_card](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/portal/portal_card.webp)

7. In the **IIS Application Name** box, enter an IIS deployment name for the portal. This name
   should be unique for each portal deployed in IIS.

    - The IIS application name is used to name the portal’s directory in IIS and its physical
      directory under **X:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID 11.0\GroupIDPortal\Inetpub** on the GroupID
      server.  
      (X represents the GroupID installation drive)
    - This IIS application name is also appended to the web server address to construct the URL that
      users click to access this deployment instance of the portal. For example:  
      `https://<web-server-name>:<port>/<IIS-application-name>`  
      Hence, a different URL is constructed for each deployment of a portal in IIS.

8. In the **IIS Site** drop-down list, select a website to host the portal files. The list displays
   the websites defined on the native IIS server. _GroupIDSite11_ is the default selection.
9. In the **Service Endpoints** area, bind a Data service and a Security service with the portal.

    1. In the **Data Service** drop-down list, select a Data service for the portal to use. The list
       contains all Data services defined in GroupID.
    2. In the **Security Service** drop-down list, select a Security service for the portal to use.
       Thelist contains all Security services defined in GroupID.

10. In the **Support Information** area, enter internal contact information and resource links for
    the portal's users to obtain help while using the portal.  
    A portal includes a **Contact** link and a **Help** icon on its web interface. The **Contact**
    link launches an email application to send an email to a user or helpdesk for inquiries or
    support. The **Help** icon launches the online help for the portal in a new browser window. Both
    links are customizable, and their target email address or web address is specified in the
    **Support Information** area.

    1. In the **Support group or administrator’s email address** box, enter the email address of a
       group or user to redirect user queries to. This email address is mapped to the **Contact**
       link in the portal.
    2. In the **Help URL** box, specify the address of your company's internal support website or
       the portal’s help page, where portal users can find support material or report a problem. By
       default, this box displays the URL of the portal’s help published by Netwrix.  
       This URL is mapped to the **Help** icon in the portal.

11. In the **Select Identity Stores** area, select the check boxes for the identity stores you want
    to associate with the portal. Users in the associated identity stores can sign into the portal
    to manage directory objects, their directory profiles, and more.  
    While associating identity store(s), you may get the following message:

    ![linked_message](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/portal/linked_message.webp)

    This relates to the scenario when identity stores in GroupID have been linked, as discussed in
    the
    [Linked Identity Stores and the GroupID Portal](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/link/overview.md#linked-identity-stores-and-the-groupid-portal)
    topic. Hence, when two identity stores, IdentityStoreA and IdentityStoreB, are linked and you
    associate IdentityStoreA with the portal, this message is displayed. It alerts you to associate
    the second identity store in the linked pair (dentityStoreB) with the portal too, in order to
    benefit from the linking.

12. Each identity store associated with a portal has its own set of design settings, as listed in
    the
    [Design a Portal with Display Types](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/displaytype/overview.md)
    topic.

    If you are upgrading to GroupID 11 from GroupID 9 or GroupID 10, you can import the design
    settings for an identity store from a Self-Service portal in a previous version - as an
    alternate to defining these settings from scratch. Following are the details of the file
    containing identity store design settings for a Self-Service portal in GroupID 9 and 10:

    **Design file name:** `<Identity store name>..xml`.

    For example: ADStore.xml  
     A separate design file exists for each identity store linked with a Self-Service portal.

    **File location in GroupID 9/10:**
    `[GroupID installation drive]:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID <version>\SelfService\Inetpub\<portal name>\Design\`

**For example: C:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID 10.0\SelfService\Inetpub\TestPortal\Design\**

    Similarly, a separate file exists for each linked combo created in the Self-Service portal.  
    **Linked combo file name:** The file has the same name as that of the linked combo in the
    portal.for example, Country-State.xml  
    **File location in GroupID 9/10:** All linked combo files, regardless of the identity store they
    are used for, are available at the following path:  
    `[GroupID installation drive]:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID <version>\SelfService\Inetpub\<portal name>\Web\LinkedCombo\`  
    For example: C:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID
    10.0\SelfService\Inetpub\TestPortal\Web\LinkedCombo\

    **To import the design file and linked combo file(s), do the following:**

    1. As a prerequisite to GroupID 11 upgrade, the folder structure for the source version was
       copied to the GroupID 11 server. In this case, the design and linked combo files for all
       portals in the previous version are already available on the machine. Else copy the above
       mentioned files for the respective identity stores associated with the Self-Service portal,
       and place them on your local machine or a shared network location.
    2. In he **Select Identity Stores** area, click **Import Design** next to an identity store name
       to import the design file for it.
    3. Browse for the file to select and import it. The import process takes a while.  
       Each identity store associated with a Self-Service portal has its own design file, so make
       sure you import the correct file. For example, if Identity Store A is associated with two
       Self-Service portals, then these will be two different design files for the same identity
       store, though at different locations.
    4. After the file is uploaded, a message is displayed, showing the number of linked combos
       defined in the imported design settings and prompting you to import the respective linked
       combo files.  
       Browse to the location of the linked combo files and import those that represent the linked
       combos defined in the design settings.

13. A portal has certain advanced settings defined for it, as discussed in the
    [Manage Advanced Settings](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/server/advanced.md)
    topic.  
    If you are upgrading to GroupID 11 from GroupID 9 or GroupID 10, you can import the advanced
    settings of a Self-Service portal from a previous version as an alternate to defining settings
    from scratch. Following are the details of the file containing advanced settings for a
    Self-Service portal in GroupID 9 and 10:

    **File name:** server.xml. A separate file exists for each Self-Service portal.  
    **File location in GroupID 9/10:**
    `[GroupID installation drive]:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID <version>\SelfService\Inetpub\<portal name>\`  
    For
    example: C:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID 10.0\SelfService\Inetpub\TestPortal\

    **To import the file, do the following:**

    1. As a prerequisite to GroupID 11 upgrade, the folder structure for the source version was
       copied to the GroupID 11 server. In this case, the server.xml file for all portals in the
       previous version is already available on the machine. Else copy the server.xml file for the
       Self-Service portal whose advanced settings you want to import, and place it on your local
       machine or a shared network location.
    2. On the **Create GroupID Application** page, click **Import Settings** in the **Advanced
       Settings** area.
    3. Browse for the file to select and import it. The import process takes a while.

14. Click **Create Application**.  
    The new portal is displayed on the **GroupID Portal** tab.

## Create a Portal in Remote IIS

You can host a portal within a site in remote IIS. For this, you need to connect with the Microsoft
IIS Administration API running on the remote IIS machine.

When you create a portal in remote IIS, GroupID does the following:

- It creates a virtual directory for the portal in a preconfigured site in remote IIS.
- It creates a physical directory for the portal in the folder that is mapped to this preconfigured
  site.

The portal runs within a virtual directory in remote IIS while the portal files are physically
located on disk.

To learn about the remote IIS settings and configurations before hosting a portal, see
the[Prerequisites for Deployments in Remote IIS](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/remoteiisprerequisites.md)
topic.

**To create a portal:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Applications** in the left pane.
2. Click **Add Application**.
3. On the next page, select **GroupID Portal** and click **Next step**.
4. On the **Create GroupID Application** page, select the **Remote IIS** tile.
5. In the **Application Name** box, enter a unique name for the portal or use the default name. The
   portal is displayed in GroupID with this name.
6. In the **Deployment Name** box, enter a deployment name for the portal. This name is used to
   indicate the deployment instance for the portal in GroupID. A portal can have multiple
   deployments, for example, one in IIS and another in Docker.  
   The application name and deployment name are displayed on the portal card on the **GroupID
   Portal** tab.
7. In the **API URL** box, enter the URL of the API to use for communicating with the remote IIS
   server.  
   Make sure the
   [Microsoft IIS Administration API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis-administration/) is
   installed as a Windows service on the remote IIS machine. Fetch the URL of this API from remote
   IIS and provide it here to enable communication.
8. In the **Access Token** box, enter the access token to allow Admin Center to access the Microsoft
   IIS Administration API. This access token is generated from the Microsoft IIS Administration
   API’s interface.
9. In the **Username** and **Password** boxes, enter the credentials of a Windows account to
   communicate with the API. This account must have access to the remote IIS machine, with
   sufficient permissions to enable you to create and manipulate objects in IIS.
10. In the **IIS Application Name** box, enter an IIS deployment name for the portal. This name
    should be unique for each portal deployed within the same site in remote IIS.

    - The IIS application name is used to name the portal’s directory in the IIS site and its
      physical directory on the remote IIS machine. The physical directory is created within the
      folder that is mapped to the preconfigured site, and portal files are copied to it.
    - This IIS application name is also appended to the web server address to construct the URL that
      users click to access this deployment instance of the portal. For example:  
      `https://<web-server-name>:<port>/<IIS-application-name>`  
      Hence, a different URL is constructed for each deployment of a portal in remote IIS.

11. On providing the above information, the **Website** drop-down list displays the sites defined on
    the remote IIS server. Select the site that you have configured with the appropriate permissions
    for GroupID.
12. For entering information in the **Service Endpoints**, **Support Information**, **Select
    Identity Stores**, and **Advanced Settings** areas, follow steps 9-13 in the
    [Create a Portal in Native IIS](#create-a-portal-in-native-iis) topic.
13. Click **Create Application**.  
    The new portal is displayed on the **GroupID Portal** tab.

## Create a Portal in Docker

GroupID enables you to host a portal in Docker. For this, you need to connect with the API running
on a Docker deamon in your environment, so that GroupID can create a container for the portal there
and run the portal from within that container.

For an overview on application deployment in Docker, see the
[Prerequisites for Deployments in Docker](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/dockerprerequisites.md)
topic.

:::note
To host the portal, Docker daemon should be configured to run Windows containers.
:::


**To create a portal:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Applications** in the left pane.
2. Click **Add Application**.
3. On the next page, select **GroupID Portal** and click **Next step**.
4. On the **Create GroupID Application** page, select the **Docker** tile.
5. In the **Application Name** box, enter a unique name for the portal or use the default name. The
   portal is displayed in GroupID with this name.
6. In the **Deployment Name** box, enter a deployment name for the portal. This name is used to
   indicate the deployment instance for the portal in GroupID. A portal can have multiple
   deployments, for example, one in IIS and another in Docker.  
   The application name and deployment name are displayed on the portal card on the **GroupID
   Portal** tab.
7. In the **Port** box, enter the port for the host machine to map the container to host ports. By
   default, the container port is 443.  
   This enables network access to the portal in Docker over this port.
8. In the **Service URL** box, enter the API URL to use for accessing and communicating with Docker
   Engine.  
   On installing Docker Engine, you must expose an API over TCP on the same machine to enable
   communication with GroupID.  
   The URL you provide in the **Service URL** box identifies the Docker deamon where you want to
   host the portal.
9. In the **Container Name** box, enter a name for the container that is created in Docker for
   deploying the portal.
10. For entering information in the **Service Endpoints**, **Support Information**, **Select
    Identity Stores**, and **Advanced Settings** areas, follow steps 9-13 in the
    [Create a Portal in Native IIS](#create-a-portal-in-native-iis) topic.
11. Click **Create Application**.  
    The new portal is displayed on the **GroupID Portal** tab.

## Deploy Another Instance of a Portal

You can deploy more than one instance of a portal. Instances can be deployed in different web
servers, for example, one in IIS, another in remote IIS, and yet another in Docker. For more on how
instances work, see the
[Deploy Multiple Instances of a Portal](#deploy-multiple-instances-of-a-portal) topic.

To deploy a new instance, you have to provide deployment details only. All instances share the same
server and design configurations, while only deployment details differ. For example, all instances
serve the same identity stores and have the same display and search-related configurations. Changing
a shared setting propagates to all deployment instances of the portal.

**To deploy an instance:**

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.
2. On the **GroupID Portal** tab, click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Deploy Another
   Instance**.
3. On the **Deploy Another Instance** page, select the **IIS**, **Remote IIS**, or **Docker** tile
   to indicate the web server where you want to deploy the instance.  
   The **Application Name** field displays the name of the portal as read-only.
4. Fields on the page vary, depending on the web server selected. In any case, the **Support
   Information**, **Select Identity Stores**, and **Advanced Settings** areas are not available, as
   they remain the same for all instances.

    - To deploy an instance in native IIS, follow steps 6-9 in the
      [Create a Portal in Native IIS](#create-a-portal-in-native-iis) topic.
    - To deploy an instance in remote IIS, follow steps 6-12 in the
      [Create a Portal in Remote IIS](#create-a-portal-in-remote-iis) topic.
    - To deploy an instance in Docker, follow steps 6-10 in the
      [Create a Portal in Docker](#create-a-portal-in-docker) topic.

5. After entering the required information, click **Deploy Instance**.  
   The new instance is displayed on the portal’s card.

## Create a Portal by Copying an Existing Portal

You can create a new portal by copying an existing portal. All server and design configurations of
the template portal are duplicated to the new portal. Deployment details are not duplicated, hence
you can choose to deploy the new portal in any of the supported web servers.

**To create a portal:**

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.
2. On the **GroupID Portal** tab, click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Copy**.  
   The **Copy GroupID Application** page is displayed; populated with the following settings of the
   copied portal:

    - The Data service and Security service linked to the portal
    - The support information for the portal, i.e., the admin/helpdesk contact email address and the
      portal’s help URL
    - The identity store(s) associated with the portal

3. You can deploy the new portal in native IIS, remote IIS, or Docker.

    - To specify settings for a native IIS deployment, follow the instructions in the
      [Create a Portal in Native IIS](#create-a-portal-in-native-iis) topic, beginning at step 4.
    - To specify settings for a remote IIS deployment, follow the instructions in the
      [Create a Portal in Remote IIS](#create-a-portal-in-remote-iis) topic, beginning at step 4.
    - To specify settings for a Docker deployment, follow the instructions in the
      [Create a Portal in Docker](#create-a-portal-in-docker) topic, beginning at step 4.

## View the Details of a Portal

1. In Admin Center, click **Applications** in the left pane.  
   The **GroupID Portal** tab displays the portals that you have created.
2. The card for a portal displays the following information:

    | Info                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

A tile shows the deployment name of the instance and the web server where it is deployed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    | Status               | A portal has one of the following statuses: - **Running:** Indicates that the portal is up and running. - **Stopped:** Indicates that GroupID is unable to communicate with the portal. To troubleshoot, go to the web server where the portal is deployed and make sure the portal is running. - **Error:** Any issue other than _stopped_ is categorized as _error_. In this case, contact your system administrator.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
    | Launch Application   | Click this link to launch the portal. When multiple deployments of a portal are available, select the tile for a deployment instance and click this link to launch that instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
    | Ellipsis             | Click it to launch a shortcut menu with the following options: - **Settings:** Launches the portal settings page, where you can manage server and design settings. - **Server Settings:** Includes the deployment details of each portal instance, the help URL for the portal, the identity stores linked with the portal, and more. - **Design settings:** These settings relate to the portal’s user interface. - **Deploy Another Instance:** Enables you to deploy another instance of the portal. - **Copy:** Enables you to create a new portal by copying the settings of this portal. - **Delete:** Deletes the portal. |

You may notice a portal with an orange card and an orange icon on the card. On hovering the mouse
over the icon, the tooltip says that _linked mode will not be allowed_. This relates to the scenario
when identity stores in GroupID have been linked, as discussed in the
[Linked Identity Stores and the GroupID Portal](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/link/overview.md#linked-identity-stores-and-the-groupid-portal)
topic. Hence, when two identity stores, IdentityStoreA and IdentityStoreB, are linked and you
associate IdentityStoreA with the portal, the portal card appears in orange. It informs you to
associate the second identity store in the linked pair (dentityStoreB) with the portal too, in order
to benefit from the linking.

## Launch a Portal

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.
2. On the **GroupID Portal** tab, click **Launch Application** on a portal’s card to launch it.

    When multiple deployments of a portal are available, select a deployment instance on the card
    and click **Launch Application** to launch that instance.

    Provide the URL of an instance to your users so they can access the portal. You can either copy
    the URL from the address bar or from a portal's deployment settings. See the
    [View the Launch URL for an Instance](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/server/nativeiis.md#view-the-launch-url-for-an-instance)
    topic.
