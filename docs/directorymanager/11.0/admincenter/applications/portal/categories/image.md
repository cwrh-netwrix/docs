# Image Display Type

Use the image display type for schema attributes of the user object type that can store image data.
The following table lists the supported attributes for Active Directory:

| AD Attribute   | CN        | Description                                                                                                                                             | Max. Image Size (KB) |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| jpegPhoto      | JpegPhoto | Stores one or more images of a user in JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF). The image stored in this attribute is mainly used by SharePoint.            | 10240                |

To define an image display type, specify the image’s display dimensions (height and width), that
would be used to display the image in the portal. You must also specify the maximum image size that
can be uploaded for this display type.

A custom image display type is rendered on a portal page as:

![photo_placeholder](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/portal/displaytype/photo_placeholder.webp)

Click **Edit** to launch the **Manage Photo** dialog box for uploading a photo. The dialog box also
provides many image editing options, including rotate, crop, flip, and re-size.

## Define an Image Display Type

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to define a custom display type for it.  
   All identity stores associated with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can
   design a different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Custom Display Types** in the left pane.
5. On the **Custom Display Types** page, click **Add** on the **Custom Display Types** tab.
6. On the **New Display Type** pane, enter a name for the display type and select _Image_ in the
   **Type** drop-down list.  
   You cannot change the name of a custom display type once you have created it.
7. In the **Height** and **Width** boxes, enter image dimensions (in pixels). The image will be
   displayed in the portal with these dimensions.  
   The default is set to 100 x 100 pixels.
8. In the **Maximum Size (KB)** box, enter the maximum image size (in kilobytes) that users can
   upload for this display type.
9. Click **OK**.
10. Click **Save** on the **Custom Display Types** page.

You can link this custom image display type to a schema attribute (such as the Active Directory
attributes _jpegPhoto_, _Photo_, _thumbnailPhoto_, and _thumbnailLogo_) on the **Search Forms,
Properties, Create Object**, and **Property Validation** pages in **Design Settings**, after which
the image placeholder is displayed on the respective portal page. Users can use it to upload their
photos.
