# Linked Combo Type - Details

Enter the following details about the linked combo on the **Details** page of the **Linked Combo
Display Type** wozard:

1. Enter a name for the linked combo in the **Linked Combo Name** box.  
   You cannot change the name of a custom display type once you have created it.
2. Next, specify the data source for the linked combo. You can either use an already uploaded file
   or upload a new one.

    - Use the **Available Data Sources** drop-down list to select an already uploaded file. This may
      be required, for example, when your source file contains the data and relationships for
      several fields, and you want to manage those relationships using multiple linked combos rather
      than one combo. Hence the need to upload the same file for multiple linked combos.  
      The list displays all the data source files previously used to create linked combos for this
      portal. To export a file, select it and click **Export**. The file is saved to the download
      location set in your browser settings.
    - To upload a new file, click **Browse** next to the **File Name** box and select the XML or
      Microsoft Excel file containing the data to populate the linked combo and the display types
      linked to it.

    If the source file is a Microsoft Excel (.xls or .xlsx) file, GroupID automatically creates its
    XML version to process it. To learn about the Excel file format, see the
    [Excel Data File Format](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/categories/linkedcombo/fileformat.md)
    topic.

3. Click **Next**.
