# Linked Combo Display Type

A linked combo is a custom display type that you can link to other display types on a portal page.
When a user selects a value from a linked combo, the values for the display types linked to it are
populated accordingly. A common application of the linked combo involves the _country, state_, and
_city_ fields. When a user selects a country, the _state_ field changes to display the states in
that country. On selecting a state, the city field displays the cities in that state.

In the default portal template, one linked combo display type _CountryState_ is defined, that
establishes a relationship between the country and state fields. Selecting a country populates the
_State_ list.

A linked combo display type also allows for more complex linking between fields, such as would be
needed to link the office, city, state, and country fields. Relationships can be extended to any
level. You can define one linked combo display type to manage these relationships, or simplify the
task by defining multiple combos, for example:

- The first linked combo establishes a relationship between the country and state fields.
- The second linked combo establishes a relationship between the state and city fields.
- The third establishes a relationship between the city and office fields.

Before creating a linked combo, you must create and maintain an external data file containing the
data and relationships for the required fields. The data source file is used to populate the linked
combo and the fields linked to it.

:::note
When defining a linked combo, consider the following:
:::


- You can define multiple linked combos for an object, provided that different attributes are used
  for the combos. For example, you define a linked combo for the user object using the company,
  department, and title attributes. To define another combo for the user object, you cannot use any
  of the previously used attributes.
- For two different object types, you can use the same attributes in different linked combos.

#### Linked Combo Data File

The linked combo requires an XML file that contains the data for the display type itself and the
other display types that will be linked to it. GroupID also supports the Microsoft Excel file format
(.xls or .xlsx), that it automatically converts to XML. The data in the Excel file must be in a
specific format for GroupID to process it.

For information about the Excel file format, see the
[Excel Data File Format](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/categories/linkedcombo/fileformat.md)
topic.

:::note
If data in the source file is updated, you must reload the file for changes to take effect.

## Define a Linked Combo Display Type

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to define a custom display type for it.  
   All identity stores associated with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can
   design a different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Custom Display Types** in the left pane.
5. On the **Custom Display Types** page, click the **Linked Combo Types** tab.
6. Click **Add** to define a linked combo display type.
7. Complete the pages of the **Linked Combo Display Type** wizard.

    1. On the **Details** page, provide the source data file. See the
       [Linked Combo Type - Details](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/categories/linkedcombo/details.md)
       topic for more info.
    2. On the **Schema** page, define the parent-child relationship between fields. See the
       [Linked Combo Type - Schema](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/categories/linkedcombo/schema.md)
       topic for details.

8. Click **OK**.
9. Click **Save** on the **Custom Display Types** page.  
   The linked combo display type is listed on the **Linked Combo Types** tab.

## Implement a Linked Combo

To use a linked combo in a portal, do the following:

1. Link a linked combo display type to a schema attribute on the **Search Forms**, **Properties**,
   **Create Object**, or **Property Validation** page in Design settings. The linked combo is
   rendered as a drop-down list in the portal.  
   On the **Schema** page of the **Linked Combo Display Type** wizard, you selected an expression
   (representing a data column in the source Excel workbook) in the **Type binding expression**
   drop-down list. Each record in this column will be displayed as a value in the drop-down list in
   the portal. When a user selects a value, it will be stored as the value of the schema attribute
   mapped to the linked combo display type.
2. The fields listed in the **Linked Field** list on the **Schema** page are already mapped to
   schema attributes. For all fields that you use in a linked combo, one of the following cases
   apply:

    - If a field’s schema attribute is already rendered as a field on the same portal page, it auto
      connects to the linked combo. Values in this field are displayed with respect to the
      expression mapped to it on the **Schema** page.  
      Let’s assume you select a field, Country, in the _Linked Field_ list, which is mapped to the
      “co” attribute in Active Directory. You link it to the ‘Country Name’ column in the source
      file. This column contains the names of all the countries in the world.  
      Now in the default portal template, the ‘co’ attribute is already rendered as a drop-down list
      on the _General_ tab in user properties and displays the names of Asian countries. When you
      apply your linked combo (containing the Country field) on the General tab, it auto-connects to
      the ‘co’ attribute and replaces its values (the list of Asian countries) with the values from
      the source data file (the names of all countries of the world).
    - If a field’s schema attribute is not previously used on the same portal page as the linked
      combo, the field will not be displayed in the portal. You must link this attribute to a
      display type and render it on the same portal page as the linked combo. Values in this field
      will be displayed with respect to the expression mapped to it on the **Schema** page.

    In any case, set the display type of each field in a linked combo to a _Textbox_ or _Dropdown_
    list, depending on the kind of values it would hold.

### Example Case for Implementing a Linked Combo

In this example, we will link a linked combo display type to the Company attribute (field) on the
General tab of the user properties page in the portal. Next, we will present how the fields used in
the linked combo should be rendered on the General tab, so that the fields are connected.

#### Step 1: Link a Linked Combo to a Schema Attribute

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings.**
4. In the left pane, click **Properties**.
5. On the **Properties** page, select _User_ in the **Select Directory Object** list.
6. The names of all tabs on the portal’s user properties page are listed under **Name**. To render
   the linked combo on the **General** tab, click **Edit** for it.
7. On the **Edit Design Category** pane, let’s link the _Company_ field to the linked combo. Click
   **Edit** for the _Company_ field.
8. On the **Edit Field** pane, select a schema attribute to map your linked combo to, and in the
   **Display Type** drop-down list, select your linked combo display type.
9. Click **OK** on the panes to close them.
10. Click **Save** on the **Custom Display Types** page.

The _Company_ field would be displayed as a drop-down list on the _General_ tab of the user
properties page in the portal. Values in this list will be populated from the combo’s source data
file, with respect to the expression selected in the **Type Binding Expression** drop-down list on
the **Linked Combo Display Type** wizard.

#### Step 2: Render the Linked Fields in the Combo on the Portal

If the fields defined in a linked combo are already rendered on the same portal page as the linked
combo, make sure that the appropriate display type is used for them. Some examples are shown in the
table below.

On the other hand, if the fields defined in a linked combo are not available on the same portal page
as the linked combo, you must create the fields first. These fields must be linked to the same
schema attributes as the combo’s fields are linked with, and an appropriate display type must be set
for them. The following table shows an example of the field names and the display types to set for
them.

| Field   | Display Type to use | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Country | Drop-down list      | Create a Drop-down List display type and use it for this field or use the default drop-down list, lstCountry. lstCountry has values defined for it, which may produce undesirable results.                                          |
| State   | Drop-down list      | Create a Drop-down List display type and use it for this field or use the default drop-down list, lstState.                                                                                                                         |
| City    | Drop-down list      | Create a Drop-down List display type and use it for this field or use the default drop-down list, lstCity.                                                                                                                          |
| Address | Text box            | Use a simple text box display type with this field.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Zip     | Text box            | Use a simple text box display type with this field or use the default textbox display type, maskZIPCode. This default display type comes with a validation check that ensures that users enter the zip code in the required format. |

## Reload the Source Data File

When you update data in the source file, you must also reload the file for changes to take effect.

**To reload the file:**

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
