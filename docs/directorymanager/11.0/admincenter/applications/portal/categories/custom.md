# Define Custom Display Types

In GroupID, several predefined custom display types are used in the default portal template. To
customize the portal, you can use the predefined custom display types as well as define new ones.

## How to Implement Display Types

On the Search Forms, Properties, Create Object, and Property Validation pages in a portal’s design
settings, select a schema attribute and a display type to link them.

On linking, the display type is rendered on the portal’s page; enabling users to view or specify a
value for the linked attribute.

## Delete a Custom Display Type

You can delete custom display types, including linked combos.

:::note
You cannot delete a custom display type that has been linked to a field in the portal.
