# Manage Log Settings

GroupID uses Windows logging and file logging to monitor events from a portal. You can set the
logging level for a deployment instance of a portal to track a specific set of information for it.

## File Logging

File logging records events for a portal’s deployment instance in a text file. When the file size
reaches 100 MB, GroupID archives it in the same directory by replacing the file extension with the
suffix _.Log.X_ and then creating a new text file with the original name. _X_ in _.Log.X_ is a
number from 1 to 10 representing the archiving order; where ‘1’ denotes the most recent file.

#### View Log Files

**For a native IIS and remote IIS deployment:**

1. Launch IIS and navigate to:  
   …\Sites\<site that hosts the service/portal instance>\<service/portal instance name>  
   Example:  
   …\Sites\GroupIDSite11\GroupIDPortal
2. Right-click this directory and select **Explore**.
3. Locate the **Logs** folder to read the logs.

## Windows Logging

Windows logging records events from a deployment instance of a portal in a centralized event log
named _Imanami GroupID_. Windows log entries are generated on the machine where IIS is running.

- For portal instances deployed in native IIS, you can view Windows logs in the Windows Event Viewer
  on the GroupID server.
- For portal instances deployed in remote IIS, you can view Windows logs in the Windows Event Viewer
  on the remote IIS machine.

The Windows Event Viewer shows a log of application and system messages, including errors,
information messages, and warnings. It is a useful tool for troubleshooting all kinds of Windows
problems.

:::note
Windows logging is not available for a portal instance deployed in Docker.

## Change the File Logging Level for a Portal Instance

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Click **Deployments** under **Server Settings**; the **Deployment Settings** page is displayed.
4. To set the file logging level for a deployment instance, first select the web server (IIS/Remote
   IIS/Docker) where the instance is deployed. Then select the instance in the **Select Application
   Deployment** drop-down list.
5. Click the **Logging** tab.
6. In the **File Logging** area, select a logging level for the instance in the **Log Events**
   drop-down list. File logging groups events into the following levels, based on the type of
   information captured:

    | Level     | Information Captured                                                                            |
    | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 1 - All   | Every event involving the portal instance; this is the highest logging level.                   |
    | 2 - Debug | Fine-grained event information that is most useful for debugging the application.               |
    | 3 - Info  | Successful operations of a functionality.                                                       |
    | 4 - Warn  | Events that are not necessarily significant, but that could potentially cause a future problem. |
    | 5 - Error | Errors that might still allow the portal instance to continue running. Default level.           |
    | 6 - Off   | No events captured; turns off file logging.                                                     |
