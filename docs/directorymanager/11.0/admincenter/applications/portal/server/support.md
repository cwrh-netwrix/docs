# Add Support for a Portal

Portals include a **Contact** link and a **Help** icon on their web interface. The **Contact** link
launches an email application to send an email to a user (such as administrator) or group (such as
helpdesk) for inquiries or feedback. The **Help** icon launches the online help for the portal in a
new browser window. Both links are customizable, and their target email address or web address can
be changed.

## Update the Support Email Address

   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Click **GroupID Support** under **Server Settings**; the **GroupID Support** page is displayed.
4. In the **Support/GroupID Administrator's Email** box, update the email address of the group or
   user responsible for responding to requests and inquiries from portal users.  
   This email address is mapped to the **Contact** link in the portal.
5. Click **Save**.

## Change the Help URL for a Portal

   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Click **GroupID Support** under **Server Settings**; the **GroupID Support** page is displayed.

   support content or report their problems. This URL is mapped to the **Help** icon in the portal.
5. Enable the **Netwrix Help** toggle button if the help URL points to the portal help published by
   Netwrix. For GroupID 11, this URL is as:  
   https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/directorymanager_11.0/page  
   Disable the **Netwrix Help** toggle button if the help URL points to help pages other than
   Netwrix help, such as when it points to your company’s internal help pages.
6. Click **Save**.

## View the Client ID Assigned to a Portal

Every GroupID client (such as Management Shell and a GroupID portal) is registered with a unique ID
in the database, known as client ID. This client ID is required while integrating a third-party
single sign-on solution that support the SAML standard, into GroupID via any of its clients.

**To view the client ID for a portal:**

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Click **GroupID Support** under **Server Settings**; the **GroupID Support** page is displayed.  
   The **Client ID** box displays the client ID assigned to the portal. It is read-only and can be
   copied for use.
