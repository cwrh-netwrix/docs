# Server Settings

A GroupID portal is deployed as a web application on a web server (native IIS, remote IIS, or
Docker). You can manage the following server-related settings for a portal:

- Change a portal’s name (i.e., the application name given to the portal).
- Update support information for the portal, i.e., the contact email address and the portal’s help
  URL.
- Specify search-related, group-related, and other advanced settings for a portal.
- Associate identity stores with a portal.

You can also view the deployment details for all instances of a portal and do the following:

- Start or stop an instance.
- Configure Windows logging and file logging for an instance.
- Delete an instance.
- Move a portal instance under a different site in IIS.

NOTE: On changing some of these settings, the portal’s session ends and all connected users are
logged out. When accessed again, the portal runs under the new configurations.
