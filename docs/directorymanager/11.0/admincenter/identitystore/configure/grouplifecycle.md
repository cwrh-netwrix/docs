# Manage Group Lifecycle Settings

GroupID can effectively manage group life cycle through all stages, from creation to deletion. It
enables you to define the following setting to control the group life cycle in an identity store:

- A default expiry policy for groups
- Exclude groups from expiration and deletion
- Prevent the expiry of security groups
- Wait period for deleting expired groups
- Group usage life cycle
- Group attestation
- Notifications for expiring groups

Of these, only the first setting, i.e., the group expiry policy, can be changed for individual
groups. All other settings apply to all groups in the identity store and cannot be changed for
individual groups.

The Group Life Cycle schedule defined for the identity store is responsible for applying the group
life cycle settings to groups. This schedule runs on containers you specify as its targets, to
process the groups that reside therein. Groups that reside outside of the target containers will not
be processed by the schedule; hence, the group life cycle policy is not applied to them. See the
[Group Life Cycle Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/grouplifecycle.md)
topic.

:::note
Before you specify a group life cycle policy for a Microsoft Entra ID identity store, see the
[Group Expiration Policy](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/advsentraid.md#group-expiration-policy)
section in the
[Microsoft Entra ID vs. Active Directory Identity Stores](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/advsentraid.md)
topic.

## Set a Default Expiry Policy for Groups

The expiry policy specifies the period for which a group remains active. When the period ends, the
group expires.

When a group is created, it inherits the default expiry policy, but you can change it for individual
groups. The Group Life Cycle schedule executes the Group Lifecycle policy as defined for the
identity store, but monitors group expiry dates as determined by each group’s expiry policy. This
job expires groups according to their respective expiry policy.

**To set a default expiry policy:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Configurations** under **Settings** in the left pane. Then click **Group Lifecycle**.
4. In the **Default Expiration Policy** drop-down list on the **Group Lifecycle** page, select an
   expiration criterion that you want to set as default. Options are:

    - Never Expire
    - Expire Every 30 Days
    - Expire Every 60 Days
    - Expire Every 90 Days
    - Expire Every 120 Days
    - Expire Every 6 Months
    - Expire Every Year
    - Other: On selecting this, two boxes are displayed. Select a unit of time (years, months, days)
      from the second list and specify a number in the first box to set a custom period for group
      expiration.

5. Click **Save**.

## Apply Policy on Specific Containers

By default, the Group Life Cycle schedule evaluates all groups that reside in the container(s)
specified as its targets, and processes them according to the group lifecycle policy. However, you
can exempt containers from the Group Life Cycle schedule, so that it does not process the groups in
those containers.

**To limit the policy to specific containers:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Configurations** under **Settings** in the left pane. Then click **Group Lifecycle**.
4. On the **Group Lifecycle** page, select one of the following options:

    - **Do not apply policy on following containers**

        1. Select this option and click **Add/Modify Container(s)**.
        2. On the **Add Container(s)** dialog box, select the containers you want to exempt from the
           Group Lifecycle policy settings and click **Add**. The selected containers are displayed
           in the **Container(s)** area. The Group Life Cycle schedule will not process the groups
           in these containers even when they are set as its targets.

    - **Apply policy only on following containers**

        1. Select this option and click **Add/Modify Container(s)**.
        2. In the **Add Container(s)** dialog box, select the container(s) you want to apply the
           Group Lifecycle policy to, and click **Add**. The selected containers are displayed in
           the **Container(s)** area. The Group Life Cycle schedule will only process groups in
           these containers in the identity store.

5. Click **Save**.

:::note
If a container is set as target in a Group Life Cycle schedule while it is also listed as an
exempted container in the Group Lifecycle policy, the schedule does not process it. As a result,
different aspects of the Group Lifecycle policy, such as group expiry and group attestation does not
apply to groups in the container.

## Exempt Security Groups from Expiry

By default, security group expiration is disabled, indicating that security groups in the identity
store cannot be expired either manually or by the Group Life Cycle schedule. You must enable it to
expire security groups.

When a security group expires, its membership is cleared. However, GroupID keeps a backup of its
membership in the database.

:::note
In a Microsoft Entra ID identity store, the security group expiry option also applies to
Office 365 groups.
:::


**The security group expiration paradox**

A security group may grant or restrict access to network resources to its members. Enabling security
group expiry may pose a problem; the members of an expired security group will get undesired access
to network resources, or will be denied access to resources that were assigned to it.

To manage this, make sure your critical security groups reside in the OU that the expiry policy does
not apply to. Use the **Do not apply policy on following containers** option to set the OU aside
(see the [Apply Policy on Specific Containers](#apply-policy-on-specific-containers) topic). In this
way, those groups will not expire even if you enable the expiry of security groups.

**To enable security group expiry:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Configurations** under **Settings** in the left pane. Then click **Group Lifecycle**.
4. On the **Group Lifecycle** page, select the **Expire Security Groups** check box to allow the
   expiry of security groups in the identity store. (Security groups can be expired manually and by
   the Group Life Cycle schedule.)  
   Clear the check box to prevent the expiry of security group.
5. Click **Save**.

## Auto Delete Expired Groups

You can set GroupID to auto delete expired groups x number of days after expiry. These wait days
apply to both auto expired and manually expired groups. The Group Life Cycle schedule is responsible
for deleting expired groups. These auto deleted groups are called logically deleted groups.

**To set wait days:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Configurations** under **Settings** in the left pane. Then click **Group Lifecycle**.
4. On the **Group Lifecycle** page, select the **Delete Expired Groups** check box and type the
   number of days after which you want an expired group to be deleted, starting from the expiry
   date.
5. Click **Save**.

## Enable Group Usage Lifecycle

You can set the expiry of mail-enabled distribution groups based on their usage. It is as:

- If an expiring group is used in the last x number of days, it will be renewed by reapplying the
  expiry policy to it.
- If a group is not used in the last x number of days, its life will be reduced to 7 days.

The Group Usage Service schedule time stamps each mail-enabled distribution group with respect to
its last usage. The Group Life Cycle schedule extends or reduces the life of a group based on this
information.

**To enable group usage lifecycle:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Configurations** under **Settings** in the left pane. Then click **Group Lifecycle**.
4. On the **Group Lifecycle** page, use the toggle button for **Extend** **or reduce the life of
   mail-enabled groups** to enable group usage lifecycle.
5. Select one of the following options:

    - **Extend group life if used in last x Days:** select this option button and specify x number
      of days in the box to prevent your active mail-enabled distribution groups from expiry. If an
      expiring group is used in the last x number of days, the Group Life Cycle schedule will renew
      it by reapplying its expiry policy.
    - **Reduce group life if not used in last x Days:** select this option button and specify x
      number of days in the box to reduce the life of mail-enabled distribution groups that have not
      received any email in the last x number of days.

        By default, this setting works for groups that are idle for 60 days since their creation,
        last renewal, or last usage. You can change the number of days anywhere from 1 to 360. The
        Group Life Cycle schedule will reduce the life of such groups to 7 days and send an email
        notification to the group owner or the default approver (for groups without owners),
        informing them of the approaching expiry. See the
        [Specify a Default Approver](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/workflow/advancedsettings.md#specify-a-default-approver)
        topic.

6. Click **Save**.

## Enable Group Attestation

You can enforce group owners to review and validate the attributes and membership of expiring groups
before renewing them. While enabling group attestation, consider the following:

- Group attestation does not apply to groups that have ‘Never Expire’ as their expiry policy.
- The Membership Life Cycle schedule must be defined for the identity store.
- Group attestation does not apply to excluded containers. See the
  [Apply Policy on Specific Containers](#apply-policy-on-specific-containers) topic.
- With group attestation enabled, the Group Usage Lifecycle settings cannot be applied. If those
  settings are already defined, they get disabled when you enable group attestation. See the the
  [Enable Group Usage Lifecycle](#enable-group-usage-lifecycle) topic.
- For attestation, group owners must use the GroupID portal.
- In the default portal template, a few fields (attributes) for group attestation are specified. You
  can add and remove fields to include those that you want group owners to validate and update.
- In case of a Dynasty, parent and child Dynasties have to be attested individually. Child Dynasties
  include both middle and leaf Dynasties. However, child Dynasties cannot be renewed after
  attestation, as they are renewed with their respective parent Dynasty.
- When attesting the membership of a parent Dynasty, child Dynasty, or a Smart Group, the members
  list does not include group objects for attestation. Only users and contacts are displayed. When
  attesting static groups, however, the members list also includes groups for attestation.

**To enable group attestation:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Configurations** under **Settings** in the left pane. Then click **Group Lifecycle**.
4. On the **Group Lifecycle** page, use the toggle button for **Enforce group owners to attest
   expiring groups** to enable group attestation for the identity store.
5. Select the **Enforce user to verify each member** check box to enforce group owners to verify
   each group member one by one (by individually specifying the status of each member as _active_ or
   _inactive_). When this check box is not selected, group owners can select all members in a single
   click and specify their status as _active or inactive_.
6. You can specify the duration for which inactive members remain in group membership.

    - Select the **Specify member inactive period** check box and specify a duration in days (for
      example, 5). When the status of a member is set to _inactive_, he or she is instantly removed
      from group membership in the directory. In GroupID, however, he or she remains a group member
      till the specified number of days, starting from the inactivation date. During this period,
      the member can be activated (added back to group membership). If the member is not activated,
      the Membership Life Cycle schedule removes it from group membership in GroupID when the
      specified number of days lapse.
    - If you want inactive members to be instantly removed from group membership in the directory
      and in GroupID, do one of the following:

        - Select the **Specify member inactive period** check box and specify ‘0’ in the box.
        - Do not select the **Specify member inactive period** check box.

7. Click **Save**.

## Set Group Expiry Notifications

You can choose to send email notifications 1 day, 7 days, or 30 days before a group expires, to
inform the group owners (or the default approver when the group has no primary or additional owners)
about the approaching expiry.

**To set group expiry notifications:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Configurations** under **Settings** in the left pane. Then click **Group Lifecycle**.
4. In the **Notification Options** section on the **Group Lifecycle** page, select any of the
   following options to specify when group expiry notifications should be sent:

    - 1 day before group expiration
    - 7 days before group expiration
    - 30 days before group expiration

5. Click **Save**.

**Group expiry notifications and the Group Lifecycle schedule**

The Group Life Cycle schedule handles group expiry notifications as follows:

- When no option is selected for expiry notifications, the schedule expires the groups in the
  identity store without notifying anyone.
- When notifications are enabled, the schedule notifies the primary and additional owners of the
  group, or the default approver (in case the group has no owner) about the approaching expiry. In
  case the notification could not be sent or no recipient is available, the schedule extends the
  expiry date of the group by 7 days on the group’s expiry day. It continues to do so until the
  notification is sent.
- When the **1 day before group expiration** option is selected for sending notifications and the
  Group Life Cycle schedule evaluates the group for the first time a day before its expiration date,
  GroupID will extend the group’s expiration date by 7 days.
