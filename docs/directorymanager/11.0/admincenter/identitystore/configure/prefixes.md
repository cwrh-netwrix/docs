# Set Group Name Prefixes

You can standardize group names in the directory by defining prefixes. When users create groups
using the GroupID portal, they must select a prefix, which is added to the group’s name and display
name.

:::note
The Group Name Prefixes policy does not apply when a user creates a group using GroupID
Management Shell.
:::


You can define group name prefixes (a) for an identity store, (b) for security roles in an identity
store, or (c) both at the identity store and role levels.

- Prefixes defined for an identity store are available to all security roles in an identity store.
  When creating a group, users must select a prefix to append the group’s name.
- Prefixes defined for a security role are available to role members only. You can enforce members
  to select a role-specific prefix to append a group’s name while creating a group. Role-specific
  prefixes help distinguish between groups created by different roles.
- When prefixes are defined at both the identity store and role levels, both sets of prefixes are
  available to role members in a single drop-down list. Role members can select any prefix to append
  a group’s name. However, when prefixes are enforced at the role level, role members can only
  select a role-specific prefix to append a group’s name.

:::note
(1) For a user with multiple roles, prefixes for all roles are displayed when creating or
updating groups.  
(2) If prefixes are enforced for the highest priority role of a user, he or she must select a prefix
from the list of prefixes defined for this highest priority role.  
(3) If prefixes are enforced for a role other than the highest priority role of a user, enforcement
does not apply to him or her.
:::


Consider the following:

- For existing groups, the prefix option is available for unmanaged groups (and not for Smart Groups
  and Dynasties). A user can choose to add a prefix to the group name in group properties. Once
  added, it cannot be removed.
- For managed groups (Smart Groups and Dynasties), prefixes can only be added while creating a group
  and cannot be changed or removed later.

A group naming policy defined in Microsoft Entra Admin Center has no impact in GroupID. For details,
see the
[Group Naming Policy](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/advsentraid.md#group-naming-policy)
topic.
