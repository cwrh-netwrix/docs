# Configure a Messaging Provider

GroupID can create email addresses for mail-enabled objects (groups, users, and contacts) with any
mailing system. It can be an Exchange Server (2013/2016/2019) deployed in your environment or an
external email provider such as Exchange Online and Office 365.

GroupID supports the following messaging providers:

- Microsoft Exchange 2013/2016/2019
- Office 365
- Google Workspace
- Other external providers, such as Exchange Online, Office 365, Yahoo, Gmail, and Google Groups

When a messaging provider is not available in your environment or you want to restrict the creation
of mail-enabled objects in the identity store, select the _None_ option.

## Exchange Server Priority

In environments that run multiple versions of Microsoft Exchange, GroupID enables you to set
Exchange Server priority. All messaging provider-related actions will reiterate on Exchange servers
according to priority.

Let’s assume you have an environment with:

- Active Directory 2012
- Exchange 2013 with two servers: ExchA and ExchB, where you set Exchange server priority as ExchB
  and ExchA

When you create a mail-enabled group using GroupID, it will be created in Active Directory first.
Messaging provider-related configurations will go to ExchB. In case of failure, the system will
reiterate the same action on ExchA.

between on-premises AD and Office 365.
