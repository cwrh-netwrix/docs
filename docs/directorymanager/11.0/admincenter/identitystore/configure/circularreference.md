# Manage Circular Reference

By default, GroupID checks for circular reference and does not allow it when users update objects
manually or when objects are auto updated via a GroupID schedule. If a circular reference occurs,
GroupID displays an error and prevents the user from saving the change.

Examples of circular reference are:

- When UserA is a direct report of UserB and UserB is a direct report of UserC, a circular reference
  would occur when you try to set UserA as UserC's manager.
- When you try to add a group as its member, say, add GroupA as a member of GroupA, a circular
  reference would occur.
- When GroupA is a member of GroupB, GroupB is a member of GroupC, a circular reference would occur
  when you try to add GroupC as a member of GroupA.

You can change the default setting to allow GroupID to save updates to objects even when a circular
reference occurs.
