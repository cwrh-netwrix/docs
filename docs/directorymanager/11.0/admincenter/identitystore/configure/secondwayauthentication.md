# Second Way Authentication - SWA

You can configure second way Authentication (SWA) to allow unenrolled users to access the following
functions in the GroupID portal and the GroupID mobile app:

- Account unlock
- Password reset

SWA allows only one-time access to these functions. Users must enroll their identity store accounts
in GroupID to use the stated functions again.

SWA can authenticate unenrolled users through:

- Security questions
- Mobile
- Email

Configuring these types for second way authentication is different from configuring the same
authentication types for multifactor and second factor authentication. For second way
authentication, you have to link an authentication type to a schema attribute. When resetting
account passwords or unlocking accounts using the GroupID portal or the mobile app, the value
provided by the user for an authentication type is matched to the value of the linked attribute in
the directory. If it matches, authentication is successful, and the user can perform the required
action in the portal or the app.

For example, link the _Email_ type with the _mail_ attribute. When an unenrolled user tries to reset
the account password, he or she must provide the verification code sent to his or her email address.
On providing the right code, he or she can proceed with the operation.

Second way authentication is disabled by default for an identity store. To facilitate users to avail
it, you must enable one or more authentication types.

## Enforce Users to Authenticate Using x Number of SWA Types

You can enforce users to authenticate with one, two, or all three SWA types.

When the enforced number of authentication types is less than the enabled types, (such as when you
have enabled all three SWA types and enforce users to authenticate with two), users can choose the
type(s) they want to use for authentication.

**To enforce SWA types:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Configurations** under **Settings** in the left pane. Then click **Second Way
   Authentication**.
4. On the **Second Way Authentication** page, enter a number in the **Authentication Factor (chosen
   by the end user)** box. This number must be equal or less than the enabled SWA authentication
   types. Users must use these x number of types for second way authentication.
5. Click **Save**.
