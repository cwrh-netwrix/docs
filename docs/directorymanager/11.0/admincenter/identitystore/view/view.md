# Identity Store History

In Admin Center, you can view the history data that the GroupID history-tracking function collects
for changes made to the configurations, workflows, and security roles in an identity store.

This data represents the events that history-tracking is configured to track. For example, history
is logged when a user enables enrollment for the identity store, removes an approver from a
workflow, modifies a policy for a security role, and more. History is not logged when a user
refreshes a page or previews any information.

Furthermore, if history tracking is not enabled or has been lately disabled, the **Identity Store
History** page is blank or it displays data that was logged before history-tracking was turned off.

## Filter History Data

GroupID provides filters to limit the history results displayed on the **Identity Store History**
page. You can define a criterion to filter history data by action, machine name, new value, old
value, and more.

**To define a filter:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.

   On the **Identity Store History** page, use the **History Filters** area to specify a filter.
4. In the _Select a Filter_ drop-down list, select an attribute to use for filtering history
   records. Options are:

    - Action
    - Machine Name
    - Modified On
    - New Value
    - Old Value
    - User Name

5. In the _Select an Operator_ drop-down list, select an operator to apply to the selected
   attribute. This drop-down displays the operators on the basis of the selected attribute.
   Available operators are:

**(missing or bad snippet)**

6. In the _Select a Value_ box, specify a value for the attribute. The selected attribute and
   operator determine the kind of value that can be entered in this box.  
   For some operators, such as _Present_ and _Not Present_, this field is not available. These
   operators check if a value for the attribute is present or not.

    **Add more filters** - On adding a filter, the next row is displayed, so you can add another
    filter.  
     **Remove a filter row** - To remove a filter row, click **Remove** for it.  
     **Remove the filter** - To remove all the filter rows, click **Clear**.

7. To apply the filter, click **Apply**. With multiple filters, history items that satisfy all the
   filters are displayed.
