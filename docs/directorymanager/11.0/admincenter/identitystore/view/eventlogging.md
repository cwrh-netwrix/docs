# Event Logging

GroupID employs Windows logging and file logging to maintain event logs for all GroupID clients and
services, namely:

- Admin Center
- GroupID portals
- GroupID mobile app
- Data Service (file logging only)
- Security Service (file logging only)
- Replication Service
- Email Service
- Scheduler service
- GroupID Management Shell

In case of multiple deployments of a client or service, separate logs are maintained for each
deployment instance.

Use the **Applications** node in Admin Center to manage Windows logging and file logging for each of
the above (except for Management Shell).

## File Logging

File logging records events for GroupID clients, scheduled jobs, and services in log files. Log file
location depends on where the respective instance of the client or service is deployed.

**For a native IIS and remote IIS deployment:**

1. Launch IIS and navigate to:  
   …\Sites\<site that hosts the client or service instance>\<client or service instance name>  
   Example:  
   …\Sites\GroupIDSite11\GroupIDDataService
2. Right-click this directory and select **Explore**.
3. Locate the **Logs** folder to read the logs.

Events are logged in a text file. When the file size reaches 100 MB, GroupID archives it in the same
directory by replacing the file extension with the suffix .Log.X and then creating a new text file
with the original name. X in .Log.X is a number from 1 to 10 representing the archiving order; where
‘1’ denotes the most recent file.

## Windows Logging

Under Windows logging, events for GroupID clients and services are logged to the Windows application
log.
