# Manage Local Replication Settings

You can manage the following replication settings for an identity store:

- Specify the object attributes that you want to use in the identity store. The Replication service
  then replicates the selected attributes to Elasticsearch.  
  Attributes that you do not select for replication will not be available in the identity store and
  cannot be used in GroupID functions.
- Force run the service at any given time to replicate object attributes.
- Restore object data to Elasticsearch for an identity store.

**What do you want to do?**

- Specify Object Attributes to Replicate
- Replicate a Custom Attribute
- Force Run the Replication Service (for Object Replication)
- Force Run the Replication Service (for Deleting Objects)
- Restore Object Data

## Specify Object Attributes to Replicate

For an identity store, a few attributes have been specified for replication by default. You can
modify the list as required.

**To select object attributes:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Replication** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Replication** page, the **Attribute Name** column displays a list of the object
   attributes that the Replication service replicates to Elasticsearch for the identity store.

    - Use the search box to search for an attribute in the list.  
      Simply enter a search string in the box; attribute names containing the string will be
      displayed.
    - To remove an attribute from the list, click **Remove** for it.
    - To reset to the default attribute listing, click **Reset to Default**.

5. Click **Add Replication Attributes** to add an attribute to the list.
6. The **Select Replication Attributes** dialog box displays a list of the schema attributes in the
   provider. Select the check boxes for the attributes you want to replicate for the identity store
   and click **Save**. The attributes are added to the **Attribute Name** column on the
   **Replication** page.

    :::note
    If in a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store extension attributes are added, GroupID
    Schema Replication schedule fetches the latest schema at its next run and add the newly added
    extension attributes to the **Select Replication Attributes** list. See the
    [Schema Replication Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/schemareplication.md)
    for additional information.  
    Select the required extension attributes from the **Select Replication Attributes** list and
    add them to the attribute to replicate list. See the Specify Object Attributes to Replicate
    section of the Manage Local Replication Settings topic.

7. Click **Save**

## Replicate a Custom Attribute

By default, a custom attribute for any object type (user, group, computer, public folder) is not
replicated for an identity store.

Let's assume you have a custom attribute, SerialNumber, for the user object in Active Directory. To
replicate its value in the Elasticsearch repository, do the following:

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Replication** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Replication** page, click **Add Replication Attributes** to search, select, and add the
   required attribute (for example, _SerialNumber_) to the **Attribute Name** list.
5. Click **Save** on the **Replication** page.
6. Click **Restore** on the **Restore Data** card to restore object data to Elasticsearch for the
   identity store.  
   To run replication from scratch for the object type the added attribute belongs to (i.e., user
   object in the example). empty the replication timestamp for the specific object type in the
   GroupID database.

:::note
When a Smart Group, created with a custom attribute in a previous GroupID version, is upgraded
using the Upgrade wizard, you will have to replicate the respective object type from scratch.

## Force Run the Replication Service (for Object Replication)

By default, the Replication service runs every 10 minutes. However, you can force run it any time
for an identity store to replicate object attributes to Elasticsearch.

Force-starting the service has no impact on the interval set for triggering the service on the
**Replication** page. See the
[Specify a Replication Interval for Objects](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/replication/settings.md#specify-a-replication-interval-for-objects)topic.

You can force run the Replication service for an identity store in any of the following ways:

### Method 1:

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Replicate Objects**.  
   Any changes made to the values of attributes during the last and current run of the Replication
   service are replicated to Elasticsearch.

### Method 2:

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Replication** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Replication** page, click **Run** on the **Replication Service** card to run the
   Replication service instantly. Any changes made to the values of attributes during the last and
   current run of the Replication service are replicated to Elasticsearch.  
   The card also displays the last run date and time of the service.

## Force Run the Replication Service (for Deleting Objects)

Objects that are deleted from the directory must also be removed from Elasticsearch. By default, the
interval for removing deleted objects from Elasticsearch is set to 60 minutes. You can, however,
force run the Replication service for an identity store any time to remove deleted objects.

Force-starting the service has no impact on the interval set for triggering the service on the
**Replication** page. See the
[Specify Interval for Deleting Tombstone Objects](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/replication/settings.md#specify-interval-for-deleting-tombstone-objects)
topic.

For an identity store, you can force run the Replication service (for deleting objects) in any of
the following ways:

### Method 1:

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Replicate Deleted Objects**. Any objects deleted in the directory between the last and current
   run of the Replication service will be removed from Elasticsearch.

### Method 2:

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Replication** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Replication** page, click **Run** on the **Deleted Objects Replication** card to run the
   Replication service instantly. Objects deleted from the directory between the last and current
   run of the Replication service will be removed from Elasticsearch.  
   The card also displays the last run date and time of the service.

## Restore Object Data

You may need to restore data for an identity store to Elasticsearch. The restore object data event
restores the following for an identity store:

- the current attribute values of objects (group, user, contact, computer, and OU) from the provider
  (for example, Active Directory)
- the GroupID pseudo attributes of those objects from the GroupID database to Elasticsearch

**To restore object data:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Replication** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Replication** page, click **Restore** on the **Restore Data** card to restore object
   data for the identity store to Elasticsearch.
