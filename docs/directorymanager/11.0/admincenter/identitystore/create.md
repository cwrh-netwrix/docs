# Create an Identity Store

To perform group and identity management operations in an identity provider using GroupID, the first
step is to create an identity store for that provider.

You can create identity stores for the following providers:

- Active Directory
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Generic LDAP
- Google Workspace

To create an identity store, you have to specify an identity provider and its connection details.

After creating an identity store, you must configure certain settings for it. These configurations
are discussed in the
[Configure an Identity Store](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/configure.md)
topic.

- [Create an Identity Store for Microsoft Entra ID](#create-an-identity-store-for-microsoft-entra-id)
- [Create an Identity Store for Generic LDAP](#create-an-identity-store-for-generic-ldap)
- [Create an Identity Store for Google Workspace](#create-an-identity-store-for-google-workspace)

## Create an Identity Store for Active Directory

In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.

On the **Identity Stores** page, click **Create Identity Store** in the top right corner.

On the **Create Identity Store** page, use the **Store Type** drop-down list to select an identity
provider to create an identity store for.  
This list displays the supported providers. By default, Active Directory is selected. Fields on this
page vary, depending on the provider you select.

Enter a name for the identity store in the **Name** box.

In the **Domain Name** box, enter the fully qualified name of the Active Directory domain you want
to create the identity store for.

In the **Service Account** box, enter the username of a service account or a group managed service
account (gMSA) to connect to Active Directory.

- **For a service account:** The service account must have sufficient privileges on the provider to
  facilitate group and identity management operations using GroupID. The minimum permissions the
  service account requires for Active Directory are discussed in the
  [Service Account for Active Directory and Exchange](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/requirements/permissions/adserviceaccount.md)
  topic.
- **For a gMSA:** If you provide a service account with
  ‘$’ as its last character (as in MyAdminAccounts$), GroupID entertains it as a Group Managed
  Service Account (gMSA). To use a gMSA to connect an identity store to Active Directory, make sure
  the gMSA is configured properly and has sufficient permissions. See the
  [gMSA for Active Directory](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/requirements/permissions/gmsarequirements.md)
  topic.

In the **Service Account Password** box, enter the service account password.  
Skip this box for a gMSA.

Select the **SSL Enabled** check box if the directory server is LDAP over SSL enabled.

:::note
GroupID 11 supports LDAPS; however, the Replication Service will still connect to the domain
controller via the LDAP 389 port. Hence, both LDAP and LDAPS protocols must be enabled on the domain
controller.

Click **Create Identity Store**. The **Replicate Identity Store** message is displayed. Select:

- **Later:** replicates all the objects to Elasticsearch at the next due replication time as per the
  replication settings.
- **Replicate Now:**replicates all the objects to Elasticsearch now.

The identity store is available on the **Identity Stores** page. You can specify different
configurations for it.

## Create an Identity Store for Microsoft Entra ID

In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.

On the **Identity Stores** page, click **Create Identity Store** in the top right corner.

On the **Create Identity Store** page, use the **Store Type** drop-down list to select an identity
provider to create an identity store for.  
This list displays the supported providers. Select _Microsoft Azure_.

Enter a name for the identity store in the **Name** box.

From the **Cloud** drop-down list, select the cloud where your Microsoft Entra ID tenant exists.

In the **Domain Name** box, enter the fully qualified name of the Microsoft Entra ID domain you want
to create the identity store for.

Specify the path to the PFX certificate in the **PFX Certificate** box. For that, click **Choose
File** and browse for the file. Select it and click **Open**.  
As a prerequisite, the PFX certificate must be generated on the GroupID server and exported to this
machine for upload.

In the **PFX Certificate Password** box, enter the password that was created while exporting the PFX
certificate.

In the **Registered Application ID on Azure Active Directory** box, enter the application ID
assigned to the GroupID application when you registered it in Microsoft Entra Admin Center.

In the **Registered Client Secret on EntraID** box, provide the client secret value generated
against the certificate uploaded to Microsoft Entra Admin Center while registering the GroupID
application.

If you bind a custom domain with your Microsoft Entra ID tenant and create an identity store for
Microsoft Entra ID using the credentials of that custom domain, then you must provide the name of
the primary domain in the **Primary Domain Name** box, so that the _write_ operations are not
affected.

Click **Create Identity Store**. The **Replicate Identity Store** message is displayed. Select:

- **Later:** replicates all the objects to Elasticsearch at the next due replication time as per the
  replication settings.
- **Replicate Now:**replicates all the objects to Elasticsearch now.

The identity store is available on the **Identity Stores** page. You can specify different
configurations for it.

:::note
Microsoft’s throttling policy restricts an application (such as GroupID) to create a maximum
of 3 concurrent sessions with Microsoft Entra ID. With this in view, GroupID allows only one active
session at any given time, which is used by Data service and Replication service.

## Create an Identity Store for Generic LDAP

Create a Generic LDAP identity store to connect to any LDAP version 3-compliant directory server,
such as Sun ONE directory server. This provider does not support dynamic schema detection. The
schema included for this provider mostly contains commonly used fields.

**To create an identity store:**

In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.

On the **Identity Stores** page, click **Create Identity Store** in the top right corner.

On the **Create Identity Store** page, use the **Store Type** drop-down list to select an identity
provider to create an identity store for.  
This list displays the supported providers. Select _Generic LDAP_.

Enter a name for the identity store in the **Name** box.

In the **Hostname** box, enter the fully qualified domain name or IP address of the machine that
hosts the generic LDAP server.

In the **Port Number** box, enter the port on which LDAP is running. This port is used to
communicate with the host machine.

In the **Domain Name** box, enter the fully qualified name of the domain you want to create the
identity store for.

In the **Service Account** box, enter the fully qualified username of a service account (for
example, CN=Admin,CN=Users,DC=Imanami,DC=COM) to connect to _Generic LDAP_. The service account must
have sufficient privileges on the provider to facilitate group and identity management operations
using GroupID.

In the **Service Account Password** box, enter the service account password.

Click **Create Identity Store**. The **Replicate Identity Store** message is displayed. Select:

- **Later:** replicates all the objects to Elasticsearch at the next due replication time as per the
  replication settings.
- **Replicate Now:**replicates all the objects to Elasticsearch now.
