# Manage Identity Store Links

You can link identity stores built on the supported identity providers in GroupID. In this way,
identical user and group objects existing in multiple identity stores (domains) can be linked
together and auto synced. GroupID further enables you to manage these linked identity stores.

## Link Two Identity Stores

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click **Link Identity Stores Now** in the **Identity Store
   Links** area. In case a link already exists, the **Create Identity Store Link** button is
   available.
3. On the **Link Identity Stores** page, click **Add**. The **Add Identity Stores** dialog box lists
   all the Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID identity stores created in GroupID.
4. Select two identity stores and click **Add 2 Stores**. The selected identity stores are displayed
   on the **Link Identity Stores** page.
5. Next, you have to specify the attributes for linking user and group objects in the identity
   stores. Separate filter expressions for user and group objects have to be created for this
   purpose.

    - To create a filter expression for linking user objects, click **Users**.
    - To create a filter expression for linking group objects, click **Groups**.

    The **Add Filter for Users** or **Add Filter for Groups** pane is displayed.

6. For mapping, follow these steps:

    1. Click **Add Filter** to create a filter expression to map objects.

        - The first list displays schema attributes from the first identity store.
        - Next you have one condition, i.e., _Is Exactly_.
        - The third list displays schema attributes from the second identity store.

        Select a schema attribute from the first and third lists to map them. Users with identical
        values for both attributes in the respective identity stores will be linked.

    2. (Optional) You can add more clauses to enhance the filter. These clauses must be joined by a
       logical ‘and’ or ‘or’.
        - Click **Add More Filters**.
        - Select a schema attribute from the first and third lists to map them, with _Is Exactly_ as
          the condition.
        - Select two clauses and then group them by inserting a logical ‘and’ or ‘or’.  
          To select a clause, click the down arrow next to it and choose **Select row**. On
          selecting the second clause, _AND_ and _OR_ are displayed. Select an option to group the
          clauses.  
          You can add as many clauses as required. Moreover, you can group and regroup clauses.
          Users that satisfy the filter expression will be linked.
    3. On clicking the operator, a menu is displayed with the following options:

        - **Select Group / Deselect Group:** This option is not relevant when there is only one
          group containing multiple clauses. It is relevant when you have two or more groups. Click
          it to select the respective group. Then select another group to bind them with a logical
          AND/OR.
        - **Ungroup:** Removes the logical AND/OR to ungroup the clauses in the filter expression.
          In case the operator binds two groups, this option removes the operator to ungroup them.
        - **Change to AND/OR**: Changes the logical AND to OR and vice versa.
        - **Add Clause:** Adds a new clause to the filter.
        - **Delete:** Deletes the operator along with all the clauses that the operator joins.

    4. Notice the two buttons: **Clear** and **Preview**, at the top of the filter expression.

        - **Clear:** Clears the entire filter expression, thereby deleting all attribute mappings.
        - **Preview:** Launches the **Preview Results** dialog box, where you can view identical
          user objects in the identity stores, based on the filter expression.  
          On the **Preview Results** dialog box, enter the name of an object (user or group) in the
          first box, select an identity store, and click **Preview**.

            - For an Active Directory identity store, GroupID looks up the values of the name,
              sAMAccountName, objectGUID, and distinguishedName attributes to match the string using
              the _Is exactly_ operator.
            - For a Microsoft Entra ID identity store, GroupIDlooks up the values of the
              userPrinicipalName, ObjectGUID, distinguishedName, and name (which is equivalent to
              display name) attributes to match the string using the _Is exactly_ operator.  
              Note that Microsoft Entra ID does not contain the distinguishedName attribute; however
              it is available as a pseudo attribute in GroupID and its value is the same as that of
              the distinguishedName attribute in Active Directory.

            The **Preview Results** dialog box displays the user object found in the selected
            identity store on the basis of the search string. Next to it, one of the following is
            displayed:

            - The user object identical to it in the other identity store. This is fetched on the
              basis of the mapped attributes. The display name and distinguished name of the user
              are displayed in both identity stores.
            - If no identical object is found, nothing is displayed next to the user.
            - If multiple identities of a user are found in the other identity store, then a
              **Multiple Objects** link is displayed. Click it to open a popup that lists all
              identical objects for the user found in the other identity store.

            If, on the **Preview Results** dialog box, you do not enter a user name but simply
            select an identity store and click **Preview**, all user objects from the selected
            identity store are displayed along with their linked identities in the other identity
            store. If the process takes too long, you can click the orange button at the bottom to
            terminate the process.

    5. Click **Add Filter for Users** in the bottom right corner of the **Add Filter for Users** or
       **Add Filter for Groups** pane.

        NOTE: If you have added multiple clauses but do not group them using the AND/OR operator,
        GroupID auto groups them using AND. Similarly, if you add two groups of clauses but do not
        group them using the AND/OR operator, GroupID auto groups them using AND.

        The filter is added and displayed on the **Link Identity Stores** page.  
         You can specify one filter expression for the user object and one filter expression for the
        group object.

    6. Click **Add Filter Scope** to specify a container for linked identities GroupID to link and
       sync later on when they are updated. New objects are also created in this container.

7. Click **Create Link** to save the link.

    NOTE: An identity store link is effective when the two identity stores linked together are also
    associated with a GroupID portal, say Portal A. If a portal does not exist with both identity
    store associated with it, a message is displayed to alert you to it.

    The link is displayed on the **Identity Stores** page.

## View the Identity Store Links

All identity store links created in GroupID are displayed under **Identity Store Links** on the
**Identity Stores**page.

**To view the links:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.  
   On the **Identity Stores** page, each card under **Identity Store Links** represents a distinct
   link between two identity stores. The following information is displayed for a link:

    - The names of the two linked identity stores and the identity providers they have been created
      on.
    - The object types that are linked, i.e., user and group.
    - The link status, displayed in the top right corner of the card. A link can have one of the
      following statuses:

        - **Healthy** - Indicates that both the identity stores are fully functional with
          replication occurring regularly.
        - **Errors** - Indicates that one or both the identity stores have run into errors due to
          replication or connectivity issues. Check the concerned identity store to resolve the
          issue. You will notice that the card for the respective identity store also shows ‘Error’
          as status.

2. Click the ellipsis button to launch a shortcut menu with the following options:

    - **Edit:** launches the **Link Identity Stores** page, where you can update the link.
    - **Disable:** disables the link between the two identity stores.
    - **Delete:** deletes the link.

## Edit a Link

A link between two identity stores involves (a) two identity stores (b) a filter that identifies
identical user objects in the identity stores to link them, and (c) a filter that identifies
identical group objects in the identity stores to link them.

You can edit a link to:

- Replace an identity store in the link
- Update the filter expression for a user or group object
- Remove the filter expression for a user or group object

**To edit a link:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.  
   On the **Identity Stores** page, each card under **Identity Store Links** represents a distinct
   link between two identity stores.
2. Click the ellipsis button on a card and select **Edit**.  
   The **Link Identity Stores** page opens, displaying the linked identity stores and the filters.

    - **Replace an identity store** - To change the identity store(s) in the link, either click
      **Edit** next to the identity stores’ names. On the **Add Identity Stores** dialog box, select
      the identity stores to replace the existing ones. Then click **Add 2 Stores**.  
      When one or both identity stores are replaced, the filter expression is automatically removed.
      You must create a new filter expression to establish a link between the identity stores.
    - **Modify the filter expression for user or group object** - Click **Edit** on the filter card
      for the user or group object. The **Add Filter** pane is displayed, where you can update the
      filter expression. Follow step 6a-e in the
      [Link Two Identity Stores](#link-two-identity-stores) topic to update the filter expression.  
      Modifying the filter expression for the user or group object breaks the link for the
      respective objects in the linked identity stores. Objects will be relinked on the basis of the
      new filter expression and will be synced accordingly in the GroupID portal.
    - **Delete a filter expression** - Click **Remove** on the filter card for a user or group
      object to delete it. Deleting the filter expression for the user or group object breaks the
      link for the respective objects in the linked identity stores.

        NOTE: At least one filter expression for the user object and one filter expression for the
        group object must exist for the identity store link. Else changes will not be saved.

3. After making the required changes, click **Update Link**.

## Disable or Enable a Link

When you disable a link between two identity stores, it becomes inactive and the objects in the
identity stores are not linked anymore in the GroupID portal.

A disabled link can be enabled again to relink objects in the identity stores.

**To disable a link:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.  
   On the **Identity Stores** page, each card under **Identity Store Links** represents a distinct
   link between two identity stores.
2. Click the ellipsis button on a card and select **Disable** to disable the link.  
   Click the ellipsis button for a disabled link and select **Enable** to reactivate it.

## Delete a Link

When you delete a link between two identity stores, the objects in the identity stores are not
linked anymore in the GroupID portal.

**To delete a link:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.  
   On the **Identity Stores** page, each card under **Identity Store Links** represents a distinct
   link between two identity stores.
2. Click the ellipsis button on a card and select **Delete** to delete the link.
