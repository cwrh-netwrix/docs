# Manage SMS Gateway Accounts

You can create one or more SMS gateway accounts in GroupID and link an account with an identity
store. You can also set an account as the default account, so that it is automatically linked to an
identity store created thereafter.

GroupID supports several SMS gateway providers. You can also use the Custom Gateway API to integrate
with an unsupported provider.

## Create an SMS Gateway Account

1. In Admin Center, click **SMS Gateway** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.
2. On the **SMS Gateways** page, do either of the following:

    - Click **Setup SMS Gateway** - This button is displayed when no gateway account exists in
      GroupID.
    - Click **Create SMS Gateway** - This button is displayed when one or more gateway accounts have
      been created in GroupID.

    The **Create SMS Gateway** page is displayed.

3. Enter a name for the gateway account in the **Name** box.
4. In the **Gateway Type** drop-down list, select an SMS gateway provider.  
   The list includes the gateways that GroupID supports and any custom SMS gateways that you have
   written. Selecting a gateway type displays the gateway URL, which is the web service address the
   SMS gateway uses for sending text messages.
5. Enter an account ID for the gateway type in the **Account ID** box.
6. Enter the username and password for the account in the **User Name** and **Password** boxes.
7. To communicate with the SMS gateway through a proxy server, click **Show Proxy Options**. This
   displays some additional fields for entering proxy settings. Enter the following proxy
   information:

    - **Proxy User Name** - the proxy user name, if required by the proxy server.
    - **Proxy Password** - the password for the user name.
    - **Description** - a description of the proxy connection.
    - **Proxy Domain** - the domain name or IP address of the proxy server.
    - **Proxy Host Name** - the host name of the proxy server.
    - **Proxy Port** - the port number the proxy uses.

8. Test the account settings:

    1. Click **Test Connection**.
    2. In the **Test SMS Gateway Connection** dialog box, enter a mobile phone number for receiving
       a test message. Use International format, with no spaces or special characters. For example:

    3. Click **OK** to send the message to the mobile number.

9. Select the **Set as default account** check box to link this gateway account with the identity
   stores created from this point forward.
10. Click **Create SMS Gateway** to create the gateway account.
