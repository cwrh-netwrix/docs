# Data Sources

You can create data sources in GroupID for the following providers, which include directories,
databases, and files:

- MS Excel
- MS Access
- Oracle
- SQL Server
- Text/CSV (can only be used as a source in a Synchronize job)
- ODBC
- SCIM

## Where are Data Sources Used?

Data sources are used in the GroupID portal in the following ways:

- **As source and destination in Synchronize jobs** - Synchronize jobs enable you to provision
  objects, deprovision objects, and sync data from one data source to another. See the
  [Synchronize](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/synchronize/overview.md) topic.
- **As external data source for query-based searches** - A Query Designer is used to perform
  targeted searches in the directory. While creating a search query, you can combine a data source
  with the directory to search for specific objects. See the
  [Query Based Advanced Search](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/generalfeatures/querysearch.md)
  topic.
- **As external data source for membership queries** - A Query Designer enables you to specify
  membership queries for Smart Groups and Dynasties. When you specify a data source in the Query
  Designer, GroupID reads records from it and fetches similar objects from the directory to add to a
  group's membership. See the
  [Query Designer - Database tab](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/querydesigner/database.md)
  topic.
- **As external data source for query-based searches** - Another Query Designer is used to perform
  targeted searches in the directory. While creating a search query, you can combine a data source
  with the directory to search for specific objects. See the
  [Query Based Advanced Search](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/generalfeatures/querysearch.md)
  topic.
