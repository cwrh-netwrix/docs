# Enroll with Authentication Types

When the administrator has enabled multifactor authentication and second factor authentication for
an identity store, users must enroll their identity store accounts in GroupID. Without enrolling,
they will not be able to sign into GroupID.

To enroll, a user must register his or her identity store account in GroupID using one or more
authentication types. When a user enrolls for multifactor authentication, it also suffices for
second factor authentication, and vice versa. See the
[Authentication Policy](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/authpolicy/authpolicy.md)
topic for a list of supported authentication types.

Account enrollment is a one-time process. Enrolled users must authenticate their identity store
accounts every time they have to pass multifactor or second factor authentication.

- For second factor authentication, a user must enroll his or her account with any one
  authentication type.
- For multifactor authentication, a user may have to enroll with more than one authentication type,
  depending on what the administrator has configured for a security role. See
  the[Enforce Authentication Types for Multifactor Authentication](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/policy/authentication.md#enforce-authentication-types-for-multifactor-authentication)
  topic.
