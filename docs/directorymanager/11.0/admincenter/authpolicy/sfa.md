# Configure Second Factor Authentication

You can enable second factor authentication (SFA) for a user role in an identity store. This policy
enforces role members to enroll their identity store accounts in GroupID using one or more
authentication types. Supported authentication types are discussed in the
[Authentication Policies - A Comparison](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/authpolicy/authpolicy.md)
topic.

Once enrolled, role members must authenticate their accounts using an authentication type they
enrolled with, while signing into Admin Center, GroupID portal or the GroupID mobile app. Users
enrolled with multiple authentication types can use any one type to authenticate.

:::note
GroupID SFA does not apply to Microsoft Entra ID MFA enabled users.
