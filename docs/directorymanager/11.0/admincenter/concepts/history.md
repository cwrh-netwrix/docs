# History in GroupID

In GroupID, history is tracked for:

- **Admin Center -** Actions performed in Admin Center, such as creating identity stores, SMS
  gateway accounts, changes to notification templates, and more.
- **Helpdesk -** Helpdesk-specific actions, such as account unlock and enrollment.
- **Identity store configurations -** Changes made to identity store configurations, including
  changes to security roles and workflows.
- **Identity store objects -** Modifications made to objects in an identity store, such as creating
  objects, updating attributes for an object, etc. It includes modifications made through:

    - GroupID portal (whether manually, through Synchronize jobs. or changes to object entitlements)
    - GroupID Management Shell cmdlets
    - GroupID mobile app
    - GroupID Admin Center (actions performed by schedules only)
    - GroupID APIs

Enabling history tracking

History for Admin Center and helpdesk is tracked by default and you cannot disable it.

However, history for identity store configurations and objects is disabled by default. You can
enable it for an identity store as well as choose to track all or specific actions. See the
[Configure History Tracking](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/historytracking.md)
topic.

Where is history displayed?

- History for Admin Center, helpdeak, and identity store configurations is displayed in Admin
  Center, each displayed on separate pages.
- History for identity store objects is displayed in the GroupID portal.

History Retention

The _history retention_ setting for an identity store enables you to choose whether you want to keep
history data forever or for a specific period. See the
[Retain Complete History Data](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/historytracking.md#retain-complete-history-data)
and
[Retain History for a Specific Period](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/historytracking.md#retain-history-for-a-specific-period)
topics. Your desired setting applies to all history tracked for the respective identity store,
including that tracked for helpdesk and Admin Center.

NOTE: Actions tracked under Admin Center history are independent of an identity store. In this case,
history retention settings apply to a history item in the context of the identity store selected by
the user to log into Admin Center to perform that action.  
**Example:** UserA selects IdentityStoreA to sign into Admin Center and creates an SMS gateway
account. This user then selects IdentityStoreB to sign into Admin Center and creates a GroupID
portal. Both actions are logged in Admin Center history. However, history retention setting of
IdentityStoreA will apply to the SMS gateway account creation action and that of IdentityStoreB will
apply to the GroupID portal creation action.

Event Logging

In addition to history tracking, GroupID provides event logging, which includes file logging and
Windows logging for GroupID clients and services. See the
[Event Logging](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/view/eventlogging.md)
topic.
