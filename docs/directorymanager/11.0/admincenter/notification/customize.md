# Customize Notifications

GroupID generates a variety of notifications for different events, such as when changes are made to
a group, when workflows are triggered, and when profile validation is due for users. Supported
languages for notifications are listed in the
[Localization](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/gettingstarted.md#localization) topic.

Templates for all GroupID notifications are available in these languages. You can customize a
notification template for the following in each of the supported languages:

- Subject line
- Message (content and format)

By default, notifications are sent to users in the English language. However, a user can opt to
receive notifications in a different language by personalizing the language settings from the
**Settings** panel in the GroupID portal.

**What do you want to do?**

- [Customize a Notification Template](#customize-a-notification-template)

## Customize a Notification Template

1. In Admin Center, click **Notifications** in the left pane. Then click **Notification Editor** on
   the **Notification Queue** page.  
   Or  
   In Admin Center, click **Notification Editor** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.

    The editor displays a list of all notifications that GroupID generates. Notification names are
    displayed in English, regardless of the language you select.

2. By default, English (US) is selected, so you can view and customize the notification templates in
   the English language. To set another language:

    1. Click **Filter**.
    2. On the **Filter(s)** dialog box, select a language in the **Locality** drop-down list.  
       This list displays the ISO codes of the supported languages.
    3. Click **Apply**.

3. You can search for a notification template using the following filters:

    - Select an event in the **Categories** list to get a list of notifications pertaining to that
      event.
    - Specify a search string in the search box at the top and press **Enter**; notification
      templates that have the string as part of their name or description are displayed. You can
      also search for a specific notification template by its name.

4. To open a notification template for editing, click **Open** for it in the **Actions** column.
5. Select a mode to view the template. Options are:

    - Source code - Click the **Source Code** tab to view and edit the notification template in the
      HTML editor.
    - Interactive - Click the **Interactive** tab to view the template in a user–friendly format.
      This is how the notification will be displayed to the recipients. You cannot format or edit
      the template in this view.

6. You can customize the notification template in the following ways:

    - [Change the Subject Line](#change-the-subject-line)
    - [Edit and Format the Content](#edit-and-format-the-content)
    - [Replace the Tags](#replace-the-tags)

7. After saving your changes, click **Go Back** to return to the Notification Editor.

### Change the Subject Line

1. In the Source Code view, click the **Title** tile.
2. In the **Edit Title** dialog box, change the subject line of the notification and click
   **Update**.
3. Click **Save** on the menu bar.

### Edit and Format the Content

You can do the following in the Source Code view:

- Control the notification format. Use HTML tags to format heading styles, change the font and font
  size, change text alignment, and more.
- Make changes to the message content.
- Replace the tags with other relevant tags. By using a tag, you can display an attribute’s value in
  the notification.

:::note
Do not insert tables or custom photos in a notification template.
:::


After making the required changes, click **Save** on the menu bar.

To aid you in content management, the Source Code view uses the same editor that powers Microsoft
Visual Studio; hence, you also have the following options available:

- Use the page navigator in the top right corner of the source code view to scroll through the
  content. The navigator is divided into sections, enabling you to jump to the beginning, middle and
  end of the source code.
- Use the options on the **Edit** menu to search for target text (whether it be a word, phrase, or
  tag), to cut the selected text, to copy the selected text, and to redo and undo an operation. You
  can also insert the current date and time in the template.

### Replace the Tags

In a notification template, variables are appended with an attribute name and enclosed in percentage
signs, to display that attribute’s value in the notification. For example,
%TARGETOBJECT_DisplayName% will resolve to the display name of the targetobject; %REQUESTER_mail%
will show the email address of the requester, and so on.

**To replace a tag:**

1. In the Source Code view, click the **Dictionary** tile to view the recommended tags to replace
   the default tags with.

    ![tag_dictionary](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/notification/tag_dictionary.webp)

    Each notification template has its own set of recommended tags.

2. Use the _Go To_ option on the **Edit** menu to search for a tag you want to replace. Refer to the
   tag dictionary to know what tags are used in the notification.
3. After replacing a tag in the template, click **Save** on the menu bar.
