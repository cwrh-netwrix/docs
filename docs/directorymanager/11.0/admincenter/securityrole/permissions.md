# Security Role – Permissions

You can allow or deny permissions to a security role on different GroupID functions.

On the **Create Security Role/Copy Security Role/Update Security Role** page, click **Select what
members can do** in the **Permissions** area to grant permissions to role members.

By default, all permissions displayed on the **Add Permissions** dialog box are denied to the new
role. Select the **Allow** option button for a permission to grant it to the role. To deny a
permission, select the **Deny** option button. After assigning the required permissions, click
**OK**.

Permissions are grouped under the following heads, with each tab representing a different head:

- [Users](#users)
- [Groups](#groups)
- [Admin Center](#admin-center)
- [Synchronize](#synchronize)
- [Password Management](#password-management)
- [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)
- [Container](#container)
- [Entitlement](#entitlement)

## Users

the GroupID portal, GroupID Management Shell, and the GroupID mobile app.

Click the **Users** tab on the **Add Permissions** dialog box.
