# Group Owners Policy

The Group Owners policy enables you to specify a group ownership criterion that role members must
fulfill when they create or update static groups and Smart Groups using the GroupID portal or
GroupID Management Shell. You can:

- Control whether groups must have a primary owner.
- Specify a range of additional owners, say 2-6, which implies that a group must have any number of
  additional owners in this range.

## Enforce a Primary Owner

The Group Owners policy ensures that groups that are created and managed using GroupID have a
primary owner. This will substantially reduce the occurrence of orphan groups in the directory.

When a new group is created using GroupID, the logged-on user is set as its primary owner. With the
primary owner enforced under the Group Owners policy, the user who creates or manages the group can
change the primary owner, but cannot remove it.

**To enforce a primary owner:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Security Roles** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Edit** for a security role.
5. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Specify policies for the members** in the
   **Policies** area.  
   The **Add Policies** pane is displayed with the **Group Owners** tab in view.
6. Select the **Primary Owner is required** check box to prevent role members from removing the
   group's primary owner while creating or updating groups. They can, however, change the primary
   owner.  
   If this check box is clear, role members can choose to remove the primary owner while creating or
   updating groups.

    NOTE: In a Microsoft Entra ID identity store, a primary owner must be specified for groups,
    regardless of whether the Group Owners policy enforces it or not.

7. Click **OK**.
8. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Update Security Role**.
9. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Save**.

## Enforce Additional Owners

You can specify a range of additional owners, say 2-10, so that role members cannot create or update
a group unless its number of additional owners fall in the given range.

By default, there is no restriction on the number of additional owners. Groups created or updated by
role members can have any number of additional owners and even no additional owner.

**To enforce additional owners:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Security Roles** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Edit** for a security role.
5. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Specify policies for the members** in the
   **Policies** area.  
   The **Add Policies** pane is displayed with the **Group Owners** tab in view.
6. In the **Minimum** box, type or select a number in the range, 0-3, to set the minimum number of
   additional owners that a group must have, when created or updated by a role member.  
   The default value ‘0’ indicates that role members can create groups with any number of additional
   owners or even without additional owners.
7. In the **Maximum** box, type or select a number in the range, 0-100, to set the maximum number of
   additional owners that a group can have, when created or updated by a role member. This value
   should either be equal or higher than the value provided in the **Minimum** box.
8. Click **OK**.
9. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Update Security Role**.
10. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Save**.

NOTE: When additional owners have been added using an earlier version of GroupID, and their number
exceeds the value of this setting, GroupID will retain them. However, more additional owners cannot
be added.
