# Query Designer Policy

You can define a role-based access policy for the Query Designer. Using the Query Designer, users
can create queries for various purposes, as discussed in the
[ Specify Smart Group Query Attributes](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/displaytype/queryattributes.md)
topic.

The Query Designer policy enables you to restrict the following Query Designer features for a
security role:

- Policy application on new groups or on existing groups as well.
- The _Start In_ container - Specify container(s) that will be displayed to role members on the
  Query Designer. Queries created by role members cannot run beyond the specified containers. You
  can also enforce the allowed containers so that role members cannot change them.
- Object types - Limit the object types that will be available to role members for including in
  queries. You can also enforce the allowed object types, so that role members cannot exclude any of
  them from queries.
- Tabs on the Query Designer - The Query Designer has multiple tabs and all of them are available to
  users by default. You can choose to hide any of these tab from role members.
- Attributes and their respective operators. - Specify the attributes that will be available to role
  members for building queries for Smart Groups and Dynasties. For each attribute, you can also
  specify the operators that role members can apply to it.

![querydesigner](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/policy/querydesigner.webp)

You can also specify a default filter criterion, involving an attribute, an operator, and a value,
that will be displayed to users on the Filter Criteria tab of the Query Designer. Role members can
change this criterion as required.

If you already have restricted some schema attributes for the Query Designer pages in portal, those
settings will be override by the schema attribute settings specified here.

## Apply the Policy to Groups

You can specify whether the defined role-based access policy for the Query Designer is to be applied
on the newly created groups (Smart Groups and dynaasties) in GroupIDÂ  11.1 only or to all existing
groups as well.

**To apply the policy on groups:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Security Roles** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Edit** for a security role.
5. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Specify policies for the members** in the
   **Policies** area.
6. On the **Add Policies** pane, click the **Query Designer** tab.
7. On the **Query Designer** tab:

    - enable the **Apply policy only to newly created groups** toggle button to apply the policy on
      the new groups created in GroupID 11.1.

        Let's say the following policy is defined for a user role:

        Start In Container: Users

        Enforce Start In Containers: Enabled

        Objects: Users with Mailboxes

        Users with External Email-Address

        Objects: Users

        Enforce Objects: Enabled

        Default filter Criteria: Department is exactly HR

        When a user of this role creates a new group the policy is applied on it.

    - disable the **Apply policy only to newly created groups** toggle button to apply the policy on
      the existing groups as well.

    After some time, if you enable the option again for the user role, the policy (with or without
    any modification) will no longer be applied to the existing groups. All the Query Designer
    configurations will be available to the user for the existing groups.

## Limit the Search Scope of the Query to Specific Containers

By default, all containers in the directory and all their sub-containers are displayed in the _Start
In_ field on the Query Designer, indicating that the query will run on the entire directory to fetch
matching objects. Users can exclude any container or sub-container, though.

You can restrict the search scope of the query to one or more containers and sub-containers for role
members. Specify the containers and sub-containers to be displayed in the **Start In** field on the
**Query Designer** dialog box. You can also enforce the container(s) so that role members cannot
remove a container or sub-container.

**To specify container(s):**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Security Roles** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Edit** for a security role.
5. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Specify policies for the members** in the
   **Policies** area.
6. On the **Add Policies** pane, click the **Query Designer** tab.
7. On the **Query Designer** tab, the **Start In Container** area lists each container and
   sub-container in the directory individually, indicating that the entire directory is set as the
   _Start In_ container.

    - To remove a container or sub-container, click **Remove** for it.
    - To modify the list of allowed containers, click **Modify Container**. On the **Modify
      Container** dialog box, select the required containers and sub-containers, and click **OK**.
      The selected containers are displayed in the **Start In Container** area.

    You can allow a sub-container even if you do not allow its parent container. In this case, the
    query will run in the sub-container but not in the parent container.

8. Use the **Enforce Start In Containers** toggle button to enforce the start-in containers.

    - When you enforce the allowed containers, they will be displayed as disabled in the **Start
      In** field on the Query Designer. Role members will not be able to change this setting.
    - When not enforced, role members can remove any of the allowed containers but they cannot add a
      container beyond the allowed ones.

9. Click **OK**.
10. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Update Security Role**.
11. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Save**.

## Limit the Objects for Use in a Query

By default, several object types are available to users on the Query Designer for including in
queries. Users select an object type from the **Find** drop-down list and then select its sub-types
on the _General_ tab of the Query Designer. The query returns the specified object types to include
in group membership. The object types and their sub-types are discussed in the
[Query Designer - General tab](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/querydesigner/general.md)
topic.

You can limit the object types available to role members for use in queries. You can also enforce
the object types so that role members cannot exclude an allowed object type from queries.

**To limit object types:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Security Roles** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Edit** for a security role.
5. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Specify policies for the members** in the
   **Policies** area.
6. On the **Add Policies** pane, click the **Query Designer** tab.
7. The **Objects** area lists the object types with their sub-types. Here is a mapping of the object
   types displayed here with the options in the **Find** list on the Query Designer:

    - Exchange = Messaging System Recipients  
      Note that the sub-types displayed under **Exchange** are the same as displayed on the General
      tab when you select _Messaging System Recipients_ in the **Find** drop-down list.
    - Computer = Computers
    - All = Users, Contacts and Groups

    Select the check boxes for the object sub-types that you want to display to role members in the
    Query Designer.

8. Use the **Enforce Objects** toggle button to enforce the allowed objects.

    - When you enforce the allowed object types, they will be displayed as disabled in the Query
      Designer. Role members will not be able to exclude any object type; hence all the allowed
      object types will be included in the query.
    - When not enforced, role members can exclude any of the allowed object types but there is no
      option to include an object type beyond the allowed ones.

9. Click **OK**.
10. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Update Security Role**.
11. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Save**.

## Hide the Tabs on the Query Designer

The Query Designer has multiple tabs, where each tab groups similar settings. These tabs are:

- General - select the object types to include in the query
- Storage - filter mailboxes
- Filter Criteria - specify a filter criteria to add objects to group membership
- Include/Exclude - specify objects to include or exclude in group membership, regardless of the
  query
- Database - combine an external data source with the directory to determine a group's membership
- Script - write scripts to manipulate group membership
- Password Expiry Options - available for Smart Groups with a password expiry condition

You can hide any of these tabs from role members.

NOTE: The General tab is displayed to all users and cannot be hidden. However, you can hide the
objects displayed on it, as discussed in the
[Limit the Objects for Use in a Query](#limit-the-objects-for-use-in-a-query) topic.

**To hide a tab:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Security Roles** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Edit** for a security role.
5. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Specify policies for the members** in the
   **Policies** area.
6. On the **Add Policies** pane, click the **Query Designer** tab.
7. The **Tabs** area lists the tabs available on the Query Designer, except the General tab. By
   default, all tabs are selected, indicating that they are displayed to role members.  
   Clear the check box for a tab to hide it from role members.
8. Click **OK**.
9. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Update Security Role**.
10. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Save**.

## Restrict the Attributes and Operators for Building a Query

By default, all schema attributes are displayed to role members for creating a filter criterion for
the query (see the **Filter Criteria** tab of the Query Designer). You can:

- limit the list of attributes to be displayed to role members
- limit the operators that role members can apply to an attribute

**To allow specific attributes and operators:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Security Roles** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Edit** for a security role.
5. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Specify policies for the members** in the
   **Policies** area.
6. On the **Add Policies** pane, click the **Query Designer** tab.
7. Click **Edit Allowed Attributes** in the **Attributes** area.  
   The **Allowed Attributes** dialog box is displayed. By default, all attributes are selected. This
   indicates that all attributes are available to role members on the **Filter Criteria** tab of the
   Query Designer for creating queries.

    - Clear the check boxes for the attributes that you do not want to display to role members. Use
      the search box to search for your required attributes.
    - You can also clear the **Allow all attributes** check box to deny all attributes, then select
      the check boxes for the required attributes. At least one attribute must be selected.

8. For each attribute, you can specify the operator(s) that can be applied to the attribute on the
   **Filter Criteria** tab.  
   On the **Allowed Attributes** dialog box, click the plus sign next to an attribute and select the
   check box for the operators you want to provide for the attribute. When role members select an
   attribute, only the respective operators will be displayed for it. For example, if you allow the
   âContainsâ and âEqualsâ operators for the âcnâ attribute, then only these operators will be
   displayed when role members select the âcnâ attribute.

    NOTE: This schema attribute setting will override the schema attribute setting specified on the
    Smart Group Attribute page in portal's design settings. See the
    [ Specify Smart Group Query Attributes](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/applications/portal/displaytype/queryattributes.md)
    topic.

9. Click **Save Selection** on the **Allowed Attributes** dialog box. The **Attributes** area
   displays the allowed attributes count.  
   To view or update the allowed attributes, click **Edit Allowed Attributes**. On the **Allowed
   Attributes** dialog box, select the **Show only selected** check box to get a list of the allowed
   attributes. Make the desired changes and close the dialog box.
10. Click **OK**.
11. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Update Security Role**.
12. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Save**.

## Specify a Default Filter Criteria

Role members can specify a filter criterion on the **Filter Criteria** tab of the Query Designer to
determine a group's membership. This criteria is created using an attribute, operator, and a value.
For example, the following criterion will add the users in the Human Resources department to the
membership of the group.

Attribute: department  
Operator: Equals  
Value: Human Resources

You can specify a default criteria, that will be displayed to role members on the **Filter
Criteria** tab. They can change it as required

NOTE: If you have limited the attributes and operators for role members, then only the allowed
attributes and operators are available to create a default filter criteria.

**To specify a default filter criteria:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Security Roles** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Edit** for a security role.
5. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Specify policies for the members** in the
   **Policies** area.
6. On the **Add Policies** pane, click the **Query Designer** tab.
7. Click **Add Filter** in the **Default Filter Criteria** area. A row is displayed for adding a
   default criterion.

    - Select a schema attribute in the first drop-down list (for example, _title_).
    - Select an operator in the second drop-down list (for example, _Equals_).
    - Enter a value for the attribute in the third box (for example, _Manager_).

    With this filter, the query would fetch users whose job titles are set to Manager. Role members
    can change it as required.

8. You can also create an advanced query by adding more rows and applying the **AND** or **OR**
   operator to group them. See steps 1-2 in the Advanced Filter section of the
   [Designate a Criterion for the Search Scope](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/policy/search.md#designate-a-criterion-for-the-search-scope)
   topic.  
   After creating a query, you can:

    - Click **Preview** to get a list of the objects fetched by the query created by the current
      settings on the **Query Designer** tab, namely the start-in container, objects, and default
      filter criteria.
    - Click **Clear** to delete the default filter criteria.

9. Click **OK** on the **Query Designer** tab.
10. On the **Edit Security Role** page, click **Update Security Role**.
11. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Save**.
