# Create a Security Role

To create a security role for an identity store, you have to specify the following:

- **Criteria** - See
  [Criteria ](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/manage.md).
- **Priority** - See
  [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/securityrole/manage.md).
- **Permissions** - Permissions refer to the different actions that role members can perform using
  GroupID, for example, creating directory objects, managing groups, managing scheduled jobs,
  managing user profiles, and more.
- **Policies** - Policies refer to settings that apply to role members. For example, the search
  policy limits role members to search for objects in a particular container.

You can create a role from scratch or by copying an existing role.

NOTE: You can disable a role to prevent its members from accessing GroupID. To prevent an individual
role member from accessing GroupID, you must remove him or her from the group or container specified
as role criteria.
