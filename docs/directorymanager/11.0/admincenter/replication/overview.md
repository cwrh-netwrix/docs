# Elasticsearch and Replication

Searches performed in GroupID are catered through Elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch relies on two services:

- **Elasticsearch Service** is responsible for searching the Elasticsearch repository and displaying
  search results when a search is performed through GroupID. If this service stops, Elasticsearch
  will not work.
- **Replication Service** is responsible for replicating attributes of the following objects from
  the provider (such as Active Directory) to Elasticsearch.

    - Group
    - User
    - Contact
    - Computers
    - Organizational Unit

The Replication service only replicates changes that are made to these objects on the directory
server. Changes made to these objects using Admin Center, GroupID portal, Management Shell, or the
GroupID mobile app, are directly saved in the Elasticsearch repository and replicated to the GroupID
database by the Data service. See the
[Data Service](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/service/dataservice/overview.md)
topic.

Synchronize directly updates objects in the directory. As soon as objects are provisioned,
de-provisioned, or updated in the directory using Synchronize, the Replication service replicates
them to Elasticsearch.

Synchronize history is saved to Elasticsearch when Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID, Generic
LDAP, or Google Workspace is the destination provider in the respective Synchronize job. This
history is replicated to the GroupID database by the Data s ervice.

:::note
The **Recycle Bin** in the GroupID portal fetches data from the directory server and not from
Elasticsearch.

## Replication Settings

In Admin Center, you can specify settings for the Replication service at the global and local
levels. Global settings apply to all identity stores in GroupID while local settings are specific to
an identity store.

- At the global level, you can schedule the service to run every x minutes to replicate object
  attributes to Elasticsearch. You can also manually restore object data to Elasticsearch. See the
  [Manage Global Replication Settings](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/replication/settings.md)
  topic.
- For an identity store, you can specify the object attributes the service should replicate to
  Elasticsearch. See the
  [Manage Local Replication Settings](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/replication.md)
  topic.

:::note
The Replication service does not replicate excluded domains for an identity store. See the
[Exclude an Active Directory Domain from Replication](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/manage.md#exclude-an-active-directory-domain-from-replication)
topic.

## Replication Service Logs

Logs for the Replication service are stored in the folder for the service on the GroupID server.

To view the logs:

1. Launch IIS on the GroupID server and navigate to:  
   …\Sites\GroupIDSite11\GroupIDReplicationService
2. Right-click this folder and select **Explore**.
3. Locate the **Logs** folder to read the logs.

Events are logged in a text file. When the file size reaches 100 MB, GroupID archives it in the same
directory by replacing the file extension with the suffix .Log.X and then creating a new text file
with the original name. X in .Log.X is a number from 1 to 10 representing the archiving order; where
‘1’ denotes the most recent file.
