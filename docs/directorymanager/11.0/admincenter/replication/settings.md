# Manage Global Replication Settings

The Replication service is responsible for replicating attributes of the group, user, contact,
computer, and organizational unit objects from a provider (such as Active Directory) to
Elasticsearch.

You can configure certain settings for the Replication service in Admin Center. You can schedule it
to run every x minutes, force run it at any time, set a threshold for triggering replication error
notifications, and view the Elasticsearch health status.

On every successful run of the Replication service, GroupID generates the replication status of
object types for each domain in an identity store and alerts you to any errors that may have
occurred during the replication process.

:::note
The Replication service does not replicate excluded domains for an identity store. See the
[Exclude an Active Directory Domain from Replication](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/manage.md#exclude-an-active-directory-domain-from-replication)
topic.

### How to Resolve Replication Errors

Possible actions to eliminate replication errors are:

- Make sure the Replication service and Elasticsearch service are running.
- Make sure Search Guard or any other security plugin you use for Elasticsearch is operational.
- Consult the Replication service logs. They provide elaborate information about the object type in
  the specific domain of the identity store the error occurred for, and whether that error comes
  from the identity provider or Elasticsearch. See the
  [Replication Service Logs](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/replication/overview.md#replication-service-logs)
  topic.

## Monitor Elasticsearch Health Status

GroupID enables you to monitor the Elasticsearch service for the following:

- The status of the Elasticsearch service. See the
  [Elasticsearch Service](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/general/dashboard.md#elasticsearch-service)
  card on the Admin Center dashboard.
- Elasticsearch cluster health stats, which include:

    - Cluster name, health status, node info and shards info
    - Cluster indices information, like health, number of documents, and status

GroupID checks if the Elasticsearch service is running, if all nodes are working, and if the cluster
is intact. It also checks the health of each index.

**To view Elasticsearch health status:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Replication** in the left pane.
2. On the **Replication** page, click **Elasticsearch Health Monitor**.

    ![es_health_monitor](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/replication/es_health_monitor.webp)

    This dialog box lists the Elasticsearch clusters in your environment, with the following
    information for each cluster:

    - **Health:** the cluster health status denoted by the following colors:

        - Green – the service is running and the cluster is intact. Moreover, two or more nodes
          exist within the cluster.
        - Yellow – the cluster is running but with warnings. It also indicates that a single node
          exists within the cluster. Elasticsearch recommends a three-node topology for improved
          performance and high availability.
        - Red – the service has stopped or the cluster is broken (for reasons such as network
          connectivity.

    - **Nodes:** the number of nodes in the cluster.
    - **Master:** the name of the master node in the cluster.

3. To refresh the information displayed, click the **Refresh** icon.
4. Click a cluster name to view it in detail.

    ![cluster_info](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/replication/cluster_info.webp)

    This dialog box displays the total number of nodes in the cluster. Each node is represented by a
    card, that displays the following for the node:

    - The name of the node
    - The system resources the node uses, such as hard disk space, RAM, and heap size
    - Node health with respect to disk space usage, denoted by the following colors:

        - Green – when hard disk space usage is 79.99% or less
        - Yellow – when hard disk space usage is 80-89.99%
        - Red – when hard disk space usage is 90% or more

5. The indices in the cluster are listed in the gird.

    - The **Name** column displays the names of the indices.
    - The **Health** column displays the health of the index, which is denoted by the following
      colors:

        - Green – the index is replicated to all nodes within the cluster.
        - Yellow – the index is replicated to some but not all nodes within the cluster.
        - Red – the index is not replicated to any node within the cluster.

    - The **Document** column shows the number of documents in the index.

6. Click the back arrow to return to the **Elasticsearch Health Monitor** dialog box.

## Specify a Replication Interval for Objects

The Replication service interval applies to all identity stores defined in Admin Center. Object
attributes to be replicated are specified in the respective identity store settings. See the
[Manage Local Replication Settings](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/replication.md)
topic.

**To set global replication interval:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Replication** in the left pane.
2. On the **Replication** page, the **Replication Service Interval** card displays:

    - the date and time the Replication service last ran
    - the date and time the service will run next
    - the interval (in minutes) between each run of the service

3. By default, the interval is set to 10 minutes, which indicates that the service is triggered
   every 10 minutes. In this way, changes made to objects in the directory during the last 10
   minutes are replicated to Elasticsearch. In Active Directory, the _whenChanged_ attribute stores
   the time and date the object was last changed. This service checks the value of this attribute
   and replicates any changes to Elasticsearch.  
   To change the interval, click **Edit** next to **Service Interval** on the on the **Replication
   Service Interval** card. Specify the interval (in minutes) between each run of the service and
   click the check mark.

## Force Run the Replication Service (for Object Replication)

1. In Admin Center, click **Replication** in the left pane.
2. On the **Replication** page, click **Force Replication Now** on the **Replication Service
   Interval** card to run the Replications service instantly.  
   Changes made to objects in the directory between the last and current run are replicated to
   Elasticsearch. Force-starting the service has no impact on the interval set in the **Service
   Interval** box for triggering the service.

## View the Replication Status for Objects

After every run of the Replication service, you can view the replication status of each object type
for each domain in an identity store. You can view which object types were successfully replicated
and which ones failed to replicate.

**To view the replication status:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Replication** in the left pane.
2. On the **Replication** page, click **Advanced Replication Status**. The **Advanced Replication
   Status** dialog box displays the status of object types for each domain in an identity store.

    1. The domains or object types that failed to replicate in the last run of the Replication
       service are displayed in red. Reasons could be inaccessibility or partial failure.
       Replication errors are brought to the administrator’s notice in the following ways:

        - On the **Identity Stores** page, the card for the identity store turns red and _Errors_ is
          displayed as the identity store status.
        - A notification is sent to relevant personnel. See the
          [Set a Threshold to Trigger Replication Error Notifications](#set-a-threshold-to-trigger-replication-error-notifications)
          topic.

        These alerts are triggered when replication fails in the last run of the Replication
        service, or if the service does not run at the required triggering interval. To resolve
        replication errors, see the
        [How to Resolve Replication Errors](#how-to-resolve-replication-errors) topic.

    2. The ‘Never replicated’ status indicates that the particular object type is not replicated
       yet. Similarly, a child domain that is not being used will have its status marked in red. To
       avoid these recurring errors, set the dates for these objects to a distant future date in the
       GroupID database. Or you can exclude a domain from replication. See the
       [Exclude an Active Directory Domain from Replication](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/manage.md#exclude-an-active-directory-domain-from-replication)
       topic.

## Specify Interval for Deleting Tombstone Objects

Objects that are deleted from the directory must also be removed from Elasticsearch. For this
purpose, you can specify a triggering interval for the Replication service to remove tombstone
objects from the Elasticsearch repository. By default, the interval is set to 60 minutes, indicating
that the service is triggered every 60 minutes. As a result, objects deleted in the directory during
the last 60 minutes are removed from Elasticsearch.

To identify objects that have been deleted in the directory but exist in Elasticsearch, the
Replication service compares the objects in both, and deletes objects that do not exist in the
directory anymore.

**To specify an interval:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Replication** in the left pane.
2. On the **Replication** page, the **Deleted Objects Replication Interval** card displays:

    - the date and time the Replication service last ran to remove tombstone objects from
      Elasticsearch
    - the date and time the service will run again
    - the interval (in minutes) between each run of the service

3. By default, the interval is set to 60 minutes, which indicates that the service is triggered
   every 60 minutes. In this way, objects that are deleted in the directory during the last 60
   minutes are removed from Elasticsearch.  
   To change the interval, click **Edit** next to **Service Interval** on the **Deleted Objects
   Replication Interval** card. Specify the interval (in minutes) between each run of the service
   and click the check mark. This Replication service interval applies to all identity stores in
   GroupID.

## Force Run the Replication Service (for Deleting Objects)

1. In Admin Center, click **Replication** in the left pane.
2. On the **Replication** page, click **Force Replication Now** on the **Deleted Objects Replication
   Interval** card to run the Replication service instantly.  
   Objects deleted in the directory between the last and current run of the service, will be removed
   from Elasticsearch. Force-starting the service has no impact on the interval set in the **Service
   Interval** box for triggering the service.

## Restore Object Data to Elasticsearch

You may need to restore object data to Elasticsearch. The restore object data function restores the
following for all identity stores in GroupID:

- the current attribute values of objects (groups, users, contacts, computers, and OUs) from the
  provider (for example, Active Directory)
- the GroupID pseudo attributes of these objects from the GroupID database to Elasticsearch

**To restore object data:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Replication** in the left pane.
2. On the **Replication** page, click **Restore Now** in the **Restore Objects Data** area to
   restore data to Elasticsearch.

## Clear Unused Indices

GroupID stores object attributes and their values in Elasticsearch, where each object type in an
identity store is distinctly indexed. In a situation where an identity store is deleted from
GroupID, its indices are not required anymore. So, you can clear them from Elasticsearch to avoid
glut.

**To clear unused indices:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Replication** in the left pane.
2. On the **Replication** page, click **Clear Now** in the **Clear Unused Indices** area. The system
   checks if there exist any indices in Elasticsearch for an identity store that no longer exists in
   GroupID.
3. The **Delete Unused Indices** dialog box displays the indices that will be deleted from
   Elasticsearch. Click **Delete** to proceed or click **Don't Delete** to close the dialog box
   without clearing the indices.  
    In case no unused indices are found, a notification pops up in the bottom right corner to inform
   that no unused indices were found.

## Change the Search Guard Password

Search Guard is a security plugin used to induce an authentication mechanism in Elasticsearch. The
option to change the Search Guard password is available when you install and manage Elasticsearch
with GroupID. Users who use their own instance of Elasticsearch cannot change the Search Guard
password using GroupID.

You can change the password of the admin account that GroupID uses to access Elasticsearch.

**To change the password:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Replication** in the left pane.
2. On the **Replication** page, click **Change Password** in the **Search Guard Settings** area.
3. On the **Change Password** dialog box, provide the current password for the Search Guard admin
   account in the **Your current password** box.
4. Specify a new password in the **New Password** and **Confirm Password** boxes.
5. Click **Change Password**.

## Set a Threshold to Trigger Replication Error Notifications

The Replication service runs every x minutes to replicate objects in an identity store. In case it
fails to replicate during a run, a replication error is displayed, as discussed in the
[View the Replication Status for Objects](#view-the-replication-status-for-objects) topic.

GroupID generates notifications to alert administrators to replication errors. By default, the
triggering threshold is set to ‘3 attempts’, which means that notifications will be sent when errors
occur in three consecutive runs of the Replication service. You can change the threshold value as
required.

Replication error notifications are sent to recipients whose email addresses are specified in the
_To_ and _CC_ boxes on the **Notifications** page. See the
[Specify Notification Recipients](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/smtpserver.md#specify-notification-recipients)
topic.

**To set a triggering threshold:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Replication** in the left pane.
2. On the **Replication** page, the **Replication Error Notification** area displays ‘3 Attempts’ as
   the default threshold for initiating notifications. This means that notifications will be sent
   when three consecutive runs of the replication service result in error. Notifications will not be
   sent when errors occur say, in two consecutive runs but no error shows in the third consecutive
   run.  
   To change the threshold value, click **Edit**. Specify a threshold value to trigger replication
   error notifications and click the check mark.
