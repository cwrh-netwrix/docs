      names, or email addresses matching the text are filtered and displayed.
    - **Search filter** - You can also search users based on enrollment. Click **Filter(s)**. The
      **Filter(s)** dialog box is displayed with the following options:

        - **Enrolled with:** click in the box and select the authentication type(s) to restrict
          search to users enrolled with any of those authentication types.

          search to users not enrolled with any of those authentication types.
