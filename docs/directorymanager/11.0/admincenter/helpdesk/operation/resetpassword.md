# Reset Passwords

Admin Center provides a variety of options to helpdesk users for resetting passwords and then
communicating them to users.

:::note
You can reset passwords of unenrolled users if (a) the **Reset Any Password** permission has
been granted to your role and (b) the Helpdesk policy for your role is set to the unrestricted mode.
:::


Helpdesk users may have to authenticate end users before resetting their passwords. See the
[Helpdesk Policy ](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/helpdesk/overview.md#helpdesk-policy)
topic.

## Reset Passwords in Unrestricted Mode

1. In Admin Center, click **Helpdesk** in the left pane.
2. The **Helpdesk** page opens to the **Helpdesk Operations** tab. Locate your required user. To
   search for a user, see
   the[Search Users](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/helpdesk/operation/search.md)
   topic.
3. Click the ellipsis button for the user and select **Reset Password**. For enrolled users, the
   **Reset Password** dialog box has two pages: **Authenticate** and **Reset**. Under the
   unrestricted mode, you can skip the former and move to the **Reset** page. For unenrolled users,
   only the **Reset** page is available.  
   Use the **History** button to view user history, i.e., the actions performed on the user and by
   the user. This history is specific to helpdesk functions, as listed in the
   [History in Helpdesk](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/helpdesk/history.md)
   topic.
4. The **Reset** page displays the user name, the identity store where this user resides, the last
   time the user changed his or her password, and the lock status of the account. In case the user
   has linked his or her accounts that exist in different identity stores, this page displays all
   linked accounts that require a password reset.  
   Select an account to reset its password.
5. Depending on the password reset method enforced for your role, you can reset the password and
   communicate the new password to the user, or you can generate a secure link and send it to the
   user for resetting the password.

    - The **New Password** tab is displayed if you are authorized to generate a new password and
      send it to the user.
    - The **Secure Link** tab is displayed if you are authorized to send a secure link to the user.
    - Both tabs are displayed if you are authorized to choose any password reset method.

6. On the **New Password** tab:

    - Enter a password of your choice in the **Password** box or click **Generate Password** to
      generate a random password.
    - Select the user's mobile number and/or email address in the **Select Mobile** and **Select
      Email** boxes to send the new password to the user by SMS or email or both.

7. On the **Secure Link** tab:

    - Select the user's mobile number and/or email address in the **Select Mobile** and **Select
      Email** boxes to send the secure link to the user by SMS or email or both. The user must click
      this link to reset his or her password.

8. Click **Reset Password**.

  before resetting their passwords. The Security Questions authentication type may be mandatory.
