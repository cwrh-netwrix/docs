# History in Helpdesk

GroupID tracks the following actions performed by end-users and helpdesk users in an identity store
and displays them as history to helpdesk users:

- Unenroll account
- Sending of secure link for password reset by helpdesk
- Change Password
- Reset Password
- Unlock Account
- Link Account
- Unlink Account
- Enroll account
- Authenticate with password, authentication types, or any other medium

History can be used for audit and analysis, such as how many users changed their passwords in the
last x days, reset their passwords using secure link, and more. It can also be used to verify the
identity of a user through the last action he or she performed.
