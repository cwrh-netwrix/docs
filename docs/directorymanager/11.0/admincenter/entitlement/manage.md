# Manage File Servers

You can specify file servers in an Active Directory identity store to replicate their entitlement
data to Elasticsearch for GroupID. You can then manage these entitlements using GroupID. Entitlement
data includes the permissions granted on shared files and folders residing on these file servers.

You can also manage certain settings for a server, such as change the service account for reading
and managing entitlements and exclude a shared folder on a file server from replication.

## Specify File Servers for Entitlement Management

To select file servers for entitlement management, you have to specify an OU or group as criterion.
GroupID fetches server objects from the specified OU or group. Once you save it, you also get an
option to add servers from outside the criterion, such as from a different OU.

You can also change the criterion, such as specify a different OU or group for fetching file
servers.

**To specify a criterion for fetching file server(s):**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Entitlement** under **Settings** in the left pane to launch the **Entitlement** page.  
   When no file server is defined, you land on a blank page.
4. Click **Set up File Server(s)**.
5. In the **Search Criteria** area, specify a _group or container_ to fetch the server objects from.
   These server objects are essentially joined to the domain the identity store is connected to.

    **Designate a container as criteria:**

    1. Select the **Container** option button.
    2. By default, the entire directory is selected. To fetch server objects from a specific OU
       rather than the entire directory, click the arrow in the box and select an OU. Then click
       **Search**. Server objects residing in this OU and its nested OUs are displayed in the
       **Included File Servers** area.

    **Designate a group as criteria:**

    1. Select the **Group** option button.
    2. Enter a search string in the box to search for your required group in the directory. You can
       also click **Advanced** to search the group by name, display name, and description. On
       selecting a group, all server objects that are members of this group will be displayed in the
       **Included File Servers** area.

6. Click **Save** on the **Entitlement** page.

#### File Server Details

The following information is displayed for a file server in the **Included File Servers** area:

- **Name:** the file server name.
- **User Name:** the user account used to connect to the file server to read and update permissions
  on shared files and folders residing on the server.

    - If the service account specified for the identity store is used, the column does not display
      anything.
    - If you have designated a different account for this purpose, the username of the account is
      displayed here. See the
      [Connect to a File Server Using a Different Account](#connect-to-a-file-server-using-a-different-account)
      topic.

- **RC Status**: Displays the replication status for the server with respect to the replication
  performed by the GroupID Entitlement schedule. Different statuses are:

    - **Request
      ![rc_request](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/ad/rc_request.webp):**
      permission data for the file server has never been replicated to Elasticsearch.
    - **Success
      ![rc_success](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/ad/rc_success.webp):**
      permission data for the file server was successfully replicated when the GroupID Entitlement
      schedule last ran.
    - **Fail
      ![rc_fail](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/ad/rc_fail.webp):**
      replication failed for the server due to an error.
    - **Running
      ![rc_running](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/ad/rc_running.webp):**
      the GroupID Entitlement schedule is running and replication is in progress.

- **Last Replicated**: the date and time the GroupID Entitlement schedule last replicated
  entitlement data for the file server to Elasticsearch. _N/A_ is displayed when the file server has
  never been replicated.
- **Status**: Click **Get Status** to check the status of the file server, represented by the
  following colors:

    - Red: The server is inactive, decommissioned, or cannot be accessed.
    - Green: The server is active and accessible.

- **Actions**: Click the ellipsis button in the **Actions** column and do one of the following:

    - Click **Edit** to view the shared folders residing on the server, include/exclude a folder for
      entitlement management, and change the service account used to connect to the server for
      reading and updating entitlements.
    - Click **Add to Exclude Server List** to exclude the file server from entitlement management.
      GroupID does not read and display entitlement data for an excluded server.

#### Search File Servers

The _Search Filters_ area is available in both the **Included File Servers** and **Excluded File
Servers** sections. Use it to search for a file server in the respective listing.

1. Click on the _Search Filters_ bar to expand the filter area.
2. Specify a filter expression to search a server by name.

    1. Select _Name_ in the **Attributes** drop-down list. This is the only attribute available for
       performing a search.
    2. Select an option in the **Operators** drop-down list.

        - _Is exactly:_ Displays the server with exactly the same name as you enter in the **Value**
          box.
        - _Contains:_ Displays the servers whose names contain the text you enter in the **Value**
          box.
        - _Starts with:_ Displays the servers whose names start with the text you enter in the
          **Value** box.
        - _Ends with:_ Displays the servers whose names end with the text you enter in the **Value**
          box.

    3. Enter a string in the **Value** box.

3. Click **Apply**. The file servers listing displays the servers that match the criterion.

## Specify File Servers Outside the Criteria

GroupID allows you to specify a group or container as criterion to fetch file servers from there for
entitlement management. But since only a single group or container can be specified as criterion,
there may be a situation where you want to specify a server from outside this criterion. To
facilitate this, GroupID enables you to search and select file servers in the domain for entitlement
management.

**To specify a file server outside of criteria:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Entitlement** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Entitlement** page, click **Include Servers other than Criteria**.
5. The **Find Servers** dialog box, by default, displays file servers from the entire directory that
   reside outside the container or group specified as criteria. Click in the box and select an OU to
   narrow down the server listing.  
   Select the check boxes for the file server(s) to include them for entitlement management.
6. Click **Save**. The selected servers are displayed in the **Included File Servers** area on the
   **Entitlement** page.
7. Click **Save**.

## Include Future Servers for Entitlement Management

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Entitlement** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Entitlement** page, select the **Include all future servers** check box to ensure that
   all server objects that are added to the group/container (specified in the **Search Criteria**
   area) in the future are automatically displayed in the **Included File Servers** area for
   entitlement data replication.
5. Click **Save**.

## View the Shared Folders on a File Server

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Entitlement** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. In the **Included File Servers** area on the **Entitlement** page, click the ellipsis button for
   a server and select **Edit**. On the **Edit Server** dialog box:

    - The **Server Shares** area displays the shared folders on the server.
    - The name of the
      [GroupID Entitlement Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/entitlement.md)
      that computes the permissions on shared files and folders residing on the server and
      replicates them to Elasticsearch, is displayed next to **Job**.

## Exclude a Folder on a Server from Replication

By default, GroupID computes and replicates permissions on all shared files/folders on the
configured servers. You can exclude a folder on a server from this activity.

When a folder is excluded, its entitlement data replicated to-date is also cleared.

**To exclude a folder:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Entitlement** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. In the **Included File Servers** area on the **Entitlement** page, click the ellipsis button for
   a server and select **Edit**.
5. On the **Edit Server** dialog box, the **Server Shares** area displays the shared folders on the
   server. Clear the check box for a folder to exclude it from replication and click **Apply
   Changes**.
6. Click **Save** on the **Entitlement** page.

## Connect to a File Server Using a Different Account

By default, the service account specified for the identity store is used to connect to a file server
for reading and managing the effective permissions assigned to objects on the shared folders. You
can designate a different account for this activity.

**To change the service account for a file server:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Entitlement** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. In the **Included File Servers** area on the **Entitlement** page, click the ellipsis button for
   a server and select **Edit**.
5. On the **Edit Server** dialog box, you can change the service account used to connect to the
   server for reading and updating permissions. The
   [GroupID Entitlement Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/entitlement.md),
   [Entitlement Scope Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/entitlementscope.md),
   and
   [Entitlement Temporary Permissions Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/entitlementtemporarypermissions.md)
   run in the context of the account specified here.

    - The **Use Identity Store Service Account** check box is selected by default, indicating that
      the service account specified for the identity store is used to connect to the server.
    - To change the account, clear the **Use Identity Store Service Account** check box and specify
      the credentials of an account in the **User name** and **Password** boxes. This account must
      have elevated permissions to manage the effective NTFS permissions for the shared resources on
      the server.  
      On changing the credentials, use the **Reconnect** button to test the connectivity and fetch
      the shared folders again with the given credentials.

6. Click **Apply Changes**.
7. Click **Save** on the **Entitlement** page.

## Replicate Permissions Manually

After adding a file server for entitlement management, it is essential to replicate object
permissions from the file server to Elasticsearch.

The
[GroupID Entitlement Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/entitlement.md)
runs on a set frequency to replicate the effective NTFS permission for the file servers. You can
also run this schedule any time manually for a specific file server or all file servers listed in
the **Included File Servers** section on the **Entitlement** page.

**To replicate permissions manually:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Entitlement** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Entitlement** page, you can manually replicate permissions for one or all file servers.

    - **To replicate permissions for a server:**Select a file server in the **Included File
      Servers** area and click **Replicate**.
    - **To replicate permissions for multiple servers:**In the **Included File Servers** area,
      select the check boxes for the servers you want to replicate. To replicate all servers, select
      the check box in the header row. This displays the following icons:

        **![replicate_permissions](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/ad/replicate_permissions.webp)**

        Either click the **Replicate** icon or the **Replicate** button.

    This triggers the GroupID Entitlement schedule for the identity store, which computes and
    replicates the effective NTFS permissions granted to directory objects on shared resources on
    the server(s). This process may take some time.

    The **Last Replicated** column displays the date and time the GroupID Entitlement schedule last
    ran.

## Exclude a Server From Entitlement Management

You can exclude a file server in the identity store from replication and entitlement management.

**To exclude a file server:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Entitlement** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Entitlement** page, you can exclude one or more servers.

    - **To exclude a server:**In the **Included File Servers** area, click the ellipsis button for a
      server and select **Add to Exclude Server List**. The server is moved to the **Excluded File
      Servers** area.
    - **To exclude multiple servers:**

        In the **Included File Servers** area, select the check boxes for the servers you do not
        want to replicate. To exclude all servers, select the check box in the header row. This
        displays the following icons:

        ![replicate_permissions](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/entitlement/ad/replicate_permissions.webp)

        Click **Remove**. The servers are moved to the **Excluded File Servers** area.

5. Click **Save**.

## Restore a Server for Entitlement Management

You can restore an excluded server in the identity store for replication and entitlement management.

**To restore an excluded server:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Entitlement** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Entitlement** page, the **Excluded File Servers** area displays the file servers
   excluded from replication. Click **Remove** for a server to move it to the **Included File
   Servers** area.
5. Click **Save**.
