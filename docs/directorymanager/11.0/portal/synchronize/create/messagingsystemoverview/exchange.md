# Exchange Subscription

While creating or editing mail enabled objects through a Synchronize job, GroupID provides you the
facility to sync or deprovision subscriptions from Office 365 messaging provider.

## Sync Exchange subscriptions

While creating or editing a Synchronize job (mailbox-enabled user) you can sync subscriptions from
Exchange messaging provider.

On the **Object, Fields and Mapping** page:

1. In the **Messaging Provider** drop-down list, select the **Exchange** version that you want to
   use.
2. Enter the domain name where the mail server resides in the **Domain** name box.
3. Enter the username and password of an authorized user account on the mail server in the
   **Username** and **Password** boxes.
4. Set Exchange server priority.

    With Microsoft Exchange as the messaging provider, the **Server Name** column in the **Server
    Status & Priority** area lists the mail servers in the environment. By default, GroupID randomly
    assigns the highest priority to a server. You can change its priority level and set the priority
    for other servers.

    If your required server is not listed, click **Sync Again**.

    1. In the **Server Status and Priority** section, select the check box for the server you want
       to specify or change the priority for.

        GroupID checks the availability of the server and displays its status as _Online_
        (available) or _Offline_ (unavailable) in the **Status** column.

    2. In the **Priority** box, select a priority level for the server, with ‘1’ representing the
       highest priority.

5. Click **Save**.
