# Scheduling and Notifications

On the **Scheduling and Notifications** page, you can set the schedule on the basis of which the job
collection can run in future and can also set the notifications settings for the job collection.

1. On the **Scheduling and Notifications** page:

    1. In the **Schedule Job Collection** section, choose from existing schedules from the drop down
       list.
    2. In the **Schedule** section, the **Task name** drop down lists the Smart Group Update jobs
       existing in the identity store for the Active Directory domain that is provided as
       destination in this Synchronize job. Select a job that you want to run along with this
       Synchronize job. The selected job will run each time the Synchronize job is run either
       manually or from the Synchronize job scheduler.

        If you are modifying an existing job collection, you can also a new schedule for the job
        collection. Visit
        [Synchronize Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/schedule/synchronize.md)

2. On the **Notifications** section, set up email notification of job collection run results. This
   feature requires Microsoft Exchange. Notifications are disabled by default and can be enabled and
   disabled from this page. Select the **Enable notifications** check box to enable them.
3. Enter the email address of notification recipients in the given box.
4. From the **Send notification** list, select the notification trigger event. Options are:

    This step requires that the identity store of the destination should be configured.
    :::


    - **Always**: Send a notification every time the job collection is run, regardless of outcome.
    - **Records are updated**: Send a notification only when one or more records have been updated.
    - **One or more errors occur**: Send a notification only when errors occur while executing the
      job collection.
    - **Job fails**: Send a notification only when a fatal error occurs causing the job collection
      to fail.

5. Select **Preview job collection when finished** checkbox to preview the job collection before
   executing it.
6. To review the information and changes regarding the job collection, click **Review Your Changes**
   at the bottom.
7. Click **Finish** to exit the wizard and create the job collection.
8. Once you run the job collection, a workflow request is triggered.
9. Generated workflow request will be displayed in the
   [Requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/request/overview.md) section for the
   workflow approver(s). If the approver approves the workflow request, the job will execute the
   results.
