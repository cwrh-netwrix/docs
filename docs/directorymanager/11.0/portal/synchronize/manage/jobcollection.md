# Manage a Job Collection

You can do the following in a job collection:

- **Duplicate a job collection** - select an existing job collection and duplicate it to create a
  new job with the same settings.
- **Remove jobs from a collection** - Suppose you add an existing job to a collection. If this job
  is deleted from the collection, the collection’s copy is deleted while the original continues to
  exist in the All Jobs list.
- **Determine the order of their execution** - specify the order in which jobs run one after
  another.
- **Specify a failure action for each job** - For each job in the collection, you can specify the
  action to take if it fails to run successfully, choosing whether to continue or to abort the
  execution of the remaining jobs in collection.
- **Set up job run notifications** - Email notifications contain a brief numerical summary of the
  objects processed by the job collection and a detailed log of statistics and errors.

    :::note
    Notification settings for individual jobs do not apply when they are run as part of a job
    collection.
