# Second Factor Authentication

The GroupID administrator can enable second factor authentication for a user role in an identity
store.

This implies that, in addition to providing a valid user name and password to connect the portal to
an identity store, role members must authenticate themselves using an authentication type.

Second factor authentication works as follows:

- An unenrolled user must enroll his or her identity store account in GroupID. See the
  [Enroll Your Identity Store Account](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/secondfactorauthentication/enrollaccount.md)
  topic. Enrollment is a one-time process.
- An enrolled user has to authenticate on the GroupID portal using the authentication type he or she
  used to enroll his or her identity store account with. See
  the[Authenticate Your Identity Store Account](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/secondfactorauthentication/authenticateaccount.md)
  topic.

    Authentication is required every time the user logs into the portal.

GroupID supports seven authentication types for second factor authentication. The administrator can
enable all or any of these for enrollment. Of the enabled authentication types, users have to enroll
and then authenticate with any one type.

## Supported Authentication Types

GroupID supports the following authentication types:

- [Security Questions Authentication](#security-questions-authentication)
- [SMS Verification](#sms-verification)
- [Email Verification](#email-verification)
- [Authenticator app](#authenticator-app)
- [Link Account authentication](#link-account-authentication)
- [YubiKey authentication](#yubikey-authentication)
- [Windows Hello authentication](#windows-hello-authentication)

### Security Questions Authentication

The administrator is responsible for configuring the security questions that users must answer to
enroll their identity store accounts using the GroupID portal. Administrators can also enroll using
GroupID Admin Center.

To authenticate using the security questions, users must provide answers to the security questions
they used to enroll their accounts with.

### SMS Verification

In SMS authentication, confirmation codes sent on the user’s mobile phone are used to enroll and
authenticate.

- To enroll an identity store account through SMS verification, a user has to enter his or her
  mobile number in the portal. The portal will send a verification code on this number via SMS and
  the user has to enter it in the portal to enroll his or her account.
- To authenticate using SMS, a user has to provide the last 4 digits of his or her registered mobile
  number. The portal then sends a confirmation code on this number; the user has to enter the code
  in the portal for authentication.

NOTE: The SMS authentication type is available if the GroupID administrator has linked an SMS
gateway account with the identity store.

### Email Verification

In Email authentication, confirmation codes sent on the user’s email address are used to enroll and
authenticate.

- To enroll an identity store account through Email verification, a user has to enter his or her
  email address in the portal. The portal will send a verification code to this email address and
  the user has to enter it in the portal to enroll his or her account.
- To authenticate using Email, a user has to complete the email address he or she provided during
  enrollment. The portal then sends a confirmation code to this email address; the user has to enter
  the code in the portal for authentication.

NOTE: The Email authentication type is available if the administrator has defined an SMTP server for
the identity store.

### Authenticator app

Users have to install the Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator app on their smartphones
and use it to enroll and authenticate their identity store accounts on the portal.

- To enroll, a user has to use the Authenticator app on his or her phone to scan the QR image
  displayed on the portal. This generates a verification code in the app, that the user has to enter
  in the portal to enroll.

    Authenticator apps generate a new code every 30 seconds, with each code expiring after 30
    seconds.

- To authenticate, the user simply has to launch the Authenticator app on his or her phone and enter
  the QR code generated by the app in the portal.

### Link Account authentication

The GroupID portal enables a user to link accounts that he or she may have in different identity
stores. When the user enrolls any one of those linked accounts in GroupID, it suffices for the
enrollment of all linked accounts.

Users can then reset their account passwords and unlock accounts through a linked account. Let’s
assume a user links his or her accounts in Identity Store A and Identity Store B. Using the Linked
Account authentication type, the user can unlock the Identity Store A account by providing the
credentials of the Identity Store B account and vice versa.

### YubiKey authentication

YubiKey is a key-sized device that users can plug into the computer’s USB slot to provide another
layer of security when accessing their identity store accounts.

YubiKey supported browsers:

- Google Chrome version 38 or later
- Opera version 40 or later
- Firefox (requires the U2F Support Add-on extension)

IE and Microsoft Edge are not supported.

- To enroll your identity store account on the portal using YubiKey, insert the YubiKey device in
  the USB slot of your computer, enter a name for your device in the portal and tap on the device.
- To authenticate with this YubiKey, insert the device in your computer and then tap on the device
  in the portal.

NOTE: Users can enroll and authenticate with a YubiKey only on a physical machine. Virtual machines
are not supported.

### Windows Hello authentication

The Windows Hello authentication type can be used on devices running Windows 10 with specialized
hardware installed, such as fingerprint reader and 3D camera.

Enable Windows Hello on Windows 10

1. Go to the **Start** menu and select **Settings**.
2. Go to **Accounts Sign-in options**.
3. Windows Hello prompts you to enter a PIN; click/tap **Add** under **PIN** to set up a PIN code
   first.

    Having set a PIN, proceed to add biometric data.

4. In the **Windows Hello** section, click **Set up** under **Face** or **Fingerprint** to add the
   recognition data.

NOTE: If your device does not meet the hardware requirements, Windows Hello is not available, even
if Windows 10 is installed on it.  
 Window Hello supports the Microsoft Edge browser only.
