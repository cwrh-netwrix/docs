# Reset Passwords

The GroupID portal enables enrolled users in an identity store reset their account passwords
securely. They can reset their passwords if they have forgotten or lost their existing passwords.
Unenrolled users can reset their passwords if the administrator has enabled the Second Way
Authentication option for their role.

The GroupID portal provides an authentication mechanism, whereby users must authenticate themselves
with Multifactor Authentication type(s) they enrolled their accounts with.

If the administrator has enabled multifactor authentication for the identity store, users must
authenticate their accounts using the authentication type(s) they enrolled their account with. After
successful authentication, users can reset account password in accordance with the password policies
the GroupID administrator has defined for your role in theÂ identity store.
