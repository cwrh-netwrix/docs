# Enroll Your Identity Store Account

With second factor authentication enabled for a user role in an identity store, unenrolled users
must enroll their identity store accounts before they can connect the portal to that identity store
and log in.

Enrolling an identity store account means that a user must register this account in GroupID using an
Authentication Type.

Once a user has enrolled his or her account, he or she must authenticate with the same
authentication types whenever he or she has to log into the GroupID portal using that account.
