The GroupID Reports enables you to generate web-based reports for an identity store. It offers a wizard guided report generation process that accounts for quick and easy reporting.

GroupID reports are organized into four categories:

- [User Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/dashboard/user.md)
- [Group Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/dashboard/group.md)
- [Computer Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/dashboard/computer.md)
- [Contact Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/dashboard/contact.md)
