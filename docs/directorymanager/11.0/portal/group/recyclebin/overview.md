# Deleted Groups

GroupID Portal handles group deletion as either physical or logical.

## Tombstone Groups

Physically deleted groups have Tombstone as type. Physical group deletion refers to manually
deleting groups using the **Delete** option on the **Actions** menu or shortcut menu. GroupID moves
a physically deleted it to the Recycle Bin while stripping it of most of its properties. You can
delete or restore a group from the Recycle Bin. The restoration process not only restores the group
to its original container, but it also reinstates the home container for the group, if deleted.

When restored, a physically deleted group is restored with limited attributes; its membership is not
restored.

A Smart Group and Dynasty is restored as a static group with no members and no query.

:::note
Tombstone groups are not available in Microsoft Entra ID.

## Logical Deletion

Groups that are deleted by the Group Lifecycle job are considered to be logically deleted. The job
deletes expired groups X number of days after group expiry, as specified in Group Lifecycle policy
settings.

Upon deletion, logically deleted groups are moved to the Recycle Bin, with all their attributes
intact. As a result, a logically deleted group, when restored, returns to its state it had at the
time of deletion. The restoration process not only restores the group to the container from where it
was deleted but it also reinstates the home container for the group, if deleted.

You can also manually delete a logically deleted group in the Recycle Bin, making it physically
deleted. Simply select the required group and select Delete on the shortcut menu.

## Deletion notifications

When the Group Lifecycle job deletes a group, it notifies the group owners or, if there is no owner,
the default approver specified in the Group Lifecycle policy.

exception, as it fetches data from the directory.

The Recycle Bin does not display data for a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store.
