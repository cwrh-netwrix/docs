# Transfer Ownership

The Transfer Ownership wizard provides a convenient way to:

- Assign ownership to orphan groups.
- Transfer group ownership (including Exchange 2016/2019 additional ownerships) from one recipient
  to another.

Depending on the number of groups and the amount of available bandwidth between GroupID and the
messaging system server (such as Exchange server) or directory server, this process may take several
minutes.

## Transfer the ownership of a group

1. In GroupID Portal, from the left pane, select **All Groups** or **My Groups** under **Groups**
   and select **Transfer Ownership** option on the top right corner.
2. On the **Containers** page, click **Browse** to select an organizational unit, domain, or the
   entire directory.

    Your selection determines where the wizard searches for the groups to transfer their ownership.
    The smaller the selection, the less time it takes to carry out the transfer.

    Specify whether to search for groups in sub-containers by selecting or clearing the **Include
    sub-containers** check box.

    The scope of this setting varies, depending on the container that you selected in the previous
    step. The following table explains the actual structures searched when you select the Include
    sub-containers option:

    | Selected Container  | Selecting Include sub-containers                                                         |
    | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Organizational Unit | Includes the Sub-organizational units in the search for required groups.                 |
    | Domain              | Includes all organizational units and their sub-trees in the search for required groups. |
    | Entire Directory    | Searches the entire forest.                                                              |

    :::note
    For Active Directory, if the search container is set to Global Catalog and Extension Data
    is not replicated to the Global Catalog, additional ownership of the groups will not be
    transferred.
