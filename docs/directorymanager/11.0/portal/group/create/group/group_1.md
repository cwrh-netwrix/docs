# Create Microsoft Entra ID Groups

Using GroupID portal, you can create static groups and Smart Groups in the identity store.

NOTE: If the GroupID administrator has specified the group creation action for review, the new group
will be created after it is verified by an approver. See the
[Requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/request/overview.md) topic.

- [Create a Smart Group](#create-a-smart-group)

## Create a Static Group

1. In the GroupID portal, click the **Create New** button in the left pane and select **Group**.

    The **Create Group** wizard opens to the **Group Type** page.

    NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create Group wizard may vary, since the administrator can
    customize the wizard by adding or removing tabs and fields.

2. On the [Group Type page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/create/grouptype.md),
   select the **Static Group** option button and click **Next**.
3. On the [General page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/create/group/general_1.md),
   specify basic information about the group.
4. On the
   [Members page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/create/group/members.md),
   add objects to group membership.

    Only user objects can be added as members of an Office 365 group.

5. On the
   [Owners page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/create/group/owners.md),
   specify primary and additional owners for the group.

    Only users can be set as primary owners. You can specify multiple primary owners for a group. At
    least one primary owner is mandatory.

6. On the
   [Summary Page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/create/activedirectory/summary.md),
   review the settings and then click Finish to complete the wizard.

## Create a Smart Group

1. In the GroupID portal, click the **Create New** button in the left pane and select **Group**.

    The **Create Group** wizard opens to the **Group Type** page.

    Remember, pages and fields on the Create Group wizard may vary, since the administrator can
    customize the wizard by adding or removing tabs and fields.

2. On the [Group Type page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/create/grouptype.md)
   page, select the **Smart Group** option button and click **Next**.
3. On the [General page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/create/group/general_1.md)
   page, specify basic information about the group.
4. On the
   [ Smart Group page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/create/group/smartgroup.md)
   page, review and modify the query for updating group membership.

    Smart Groups in an Microsoft Entra ID based identity store use a device structured query
    language to update group membership. You should either apply a query to a group in the Microsoft
    Entra ID portal or in GroupID.

5. On the
   [Owners page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/create/group/owners.md),
   specify primary and additional owners for the group.

    - Only users can be set as primary owners.
    - You can specify multiple primary owners for a group. At least one primary owner is mandatory.
    - When a Smart Group Update job runs on a group, the notification behavior is as follows:

        Even when the **Do not Notify** check box is selected, the additional owner will receive the
        notifications if the administrator has included its email address for job-specific
        notifications.

6. On the
   [Summary Page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/create/activedirectory/summary.md),
   review the settings and then click Finish to complete the wizard.
