# Group Ownership Functions

The GroupID portal enables you to perform ownership related functions such as change primary owner
of a group, specify additional owner(s) of a group, import/export additional owner and so on.

When a new group is created; by default, the group creator is set as its primary owner. However, you
can change the primary owner or even remove it, leaving the group orphan.

You cannot remove a group’s primary owner if the Group Owners policy for your role does not allow
it.

## Additional owners

You can also specify temporary and permanent additional owners for a group. These can be users,
contacts and even security groups. In case of a group, all its members will be considered as
additional owners.

You can change the ownership type of an additional owner from temporary to permanent and vice versa.

Additional owners have the same privileges as the primary owner to manage the group. Group expiry,
deletion, and renewal notifications are sent to the additional owners along with the primary owner.
However, you can exclude some or all additional owners from receiving email notifications.

By default, there is no restriction on the number of additional owners a group can have. However, if
the administrator has specified a maximum and minimum value for additional owners in the Group
Owners policy for your role in the identity store, you cannot create a group or save modifications
to it unless it has the specified number of additional owners.

## Exchange 2013/2016/2019 additional owners

Microsoft Exchange 2013/2016/2019 offers the co-managed by feature that enables you to specify
Exchange additional owners for a group, provided that Exchange 2013/2016/2019 is configured as the
messaging provider for the identity store. Exchange additional owners are stored in the
_msExchangecoManagedby_ attribute.

GroupID sends group expiry, deletion, and renewal notifications to all Exchange additional owners
along with the group’s primary owner and additional owners.

:::note
For email notifications to be sent, an SMTP server must be configured for the connected
identity store.

group. Moreover, only mail-enabled users can be set as Exchange additional owners.

    - **Temporary Owner** - To make the object a temporary additional owner of the group for the

      group for a period in the future. Use the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes to set a period.
      Before the beginning date, the object’s ownership type is displayed as ‘Addition Pending’. On

        You add Smith as a temporary additional owner of Group A on May 15, 2019 for future dates,
        May 20-30, 2019.

        Smith will be listed with Group A’s additional owners with ‘Addition Pending’ as its
        ownership type from May 15 to 19, 2019.

        On May 20, Smith will become a temporary additional owner of Group A and its ownership type

      period. Before the beginning date, the object’s ownership type is displayed as ‘Removal

        20-30, 2019.

        Smith will be displayed as Group A’s additional owner with ‘Removal Pending’ as ownership
        type from May 15 to 19, 2019.

    - **Temporary Removed** - Indicates that the object is temporarily removed from group ownership
      for the period specified in the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes. At the end of the period,
      the object is added back to the group as a permanent additional owner.

5. Save the changes.

The Managed By Life Cycle job updates the temporary ownership of groups by adding and removing
temporary additional owners on the specified dates.

Consider a scenario where the Managed By Life Cycle job is scheduled to run once a week, say
Mondays. If an object is to be added as a group’s temporary additional owner for three days -
Wednesday till Friday, it will not be added. This happens because the Managed By Life Cycle job did
not run on the particular days for temporary ownership update.
