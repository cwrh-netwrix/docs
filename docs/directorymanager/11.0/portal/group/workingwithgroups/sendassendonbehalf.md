# The Send As and Send on Behalf features

The administrator can configure the Send As and Send on Behalf features for a GroupID portal.

For the **Send As** feature, a portal user (User A) can set another object or objects in its Send As
list. An added object (User B) will be able to choose User A’s email address in the ‘From’ field
when composing a message in Outlook. In this instance, the message, while sent by User B, will
appear as sent by User A.

Similarly, for the **Send on Behalf** feature, a portal user (User A) can set another object or
objects in its Send on Behalf list. An added object (User B) will be able to choose User A’s email
address in the From field when composing a message in Outlook. However, message recipients will see
both User A’s address and User B’s address (as the actual author of the message). This means that
when User B sends a message using User A’s address, the ‘From’ address will show ‘From: Mailbox
`<User B's address>` on behalf of Mailbox `<User A's address>`'.

The administrator can provide the Send As and Send on Behalf features on any tab in
[Group Properties](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/properties/overview.md). They
are displayed as:

Use the **Add** and **Remove** buttons to add and remove objects in the Send As and Send on Behalf
lists.

:::note
Only mailboxes and mail-enabled groups can add objects to their Send As and Send on Behalf
lists.
