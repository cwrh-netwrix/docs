# Attest an Expiring Group

If the GroupID administrator enables group attestation for the identity store, then group owners
must review and validate the attributes and membership of an expiring group before renewing it.

While attesting a group, the owner can:

- Update a few attributes, such as the group’s display name, expiration policy, security type, etc.
- Verify the group’s membership and inactivate unrequired members. Inactive members are removed from
  group membership instantly or after x number of days, depending on the configurations made by the
  administrator.

A group expires when it is not attested and renewed during its expiring days.

**History Logging**

GroupID tracks and maintains history for group attestation. On the
[Object properties - History tab](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/properties/history.md)
in group properties, the following is logged:

- The date the group was attested on.
- Any attribute value updated during group attestation.
- The status of a group member set to ‘active’ or ‘inactive’.

**What do you want to do?**

- [Attest a group](#attest-a-group)

## Attest a group

1. In GroupID portal, on the left navigation bar, click **Groups.** On the **Groups** page select
   the **All Groups** tab.
2. Select an expiring group and click **Attest Group** on the toolbar.

    The button would be disabled if you select multiple groups.

3. On the **Attest Group** wizard, review the values provided for the group attributes and update
   any information, if required. Then click **Next Step**.
4. On the **Step 2: Member Attestation** page, verify the group members. The page has 3 tabs:

    - **Disabled Members**: Lists group members that are disabled in the directory.
    - **Not logged in 30 days**: Lists group members that have not logged into their workstations in
      the last 30 days.
    - **All Members**: Lists active group members only. Disabled members and those who have not
      logged in during the last 30 days are not included.

5. On each of these tabs, review the members list and set their status to _active_ or _inactive_.

    - Use the **Active All** and **Inactive All** buttons to mark the status of all members as
      active or inactive respectively. To individually mark an active member as inactive and vice
      versa, click the relevant button for it.

        The **Active All** and **Inactive All** buttons are available if the administrator has
        allowed group owners to specify the status of all member in a single click.

    - If the **Active All** and **Inactive All** buttons are not available, the group owner must
      verify each member one by one (by individually specifying its status as active or inactive.

    :::note
    Setting ‘active’ as status for a disabled user does not activate or enable the user's
    account.  
    Setting ‘active’ as status for users who have not logged in during the last 30 days does not
    move them to the **All Members** listing.
    :::


6. The **Membership** column displays the membership type for active members.

    You can change the membership type of users in all three listings – **All Members**,**Disabled
    Members** and **Not logged in 30 days**.

    Membership types are:

    - **Perpetual** - To make the object a permanent member of the group.
    - **Temporary Member** - To make the object a temporary member of the group for the period you
      specify in the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes. At the end of the period, the object is
      removed from the group membership.
    - **Addition Pending** - Indicates that the object will be a temporary member of the group for a
      period in the future. Use the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes to set a period. Before the
      beginning date, the object’s membership type is displayed as ‘Addition Pending’. On the
      beginning date, the membership type changes to ‘Temporary Member’.

        **Here is an example:**

        You add Smith as a temporary member to Group A on May 15, 2019 for future dates, May
        20-30, 2019.

        Smith will be displayed in Group A’s membership with ‘Addition Pending’ as its membership
        type from May 15 to 19, 2019. However, Smith would not be added to group membership in the
        provider.

        On May 20, Smith will become a temporary member of Group A and its membership type will
        change to ‘Temporary Member’ from May 20 to 30, 2019. Smith will also be added to group
        membership in the provider.

        After May 30, Smith will be removed from Group A as a member in GroupID and in the provider.

    - **Removal Pending** - Indicates that the object will be temporarily removed from group
      membership for a period in the future. Use the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes to set a
      period. Before the beginning date, the object’s membership type is displayed as ‘Removal
      Pending’. On the beginning date, the membership type will change to ‘Temporary Removed’.

        _Here is an example:_

        You remove Smith from Group A on May 15, 2019 for future dates, May 20-30, 2019.

        Smith will be displayed in Group A’s membership with ‘Removal Pending’ as membership type
        from May 15 to 19, 2019.

        On May 20, Smith’s membership type in GroupID will change to ‘Temporary Removed’; lasting
        till May 30, 2019. However, Smith will be removed from Group A’s membership in the provider.

        After May 30, Smith will be added back to Group A as a permanent member in GroupID and in
        the provider.

    - **Temporary Removed** - Indicates that the object is temporarily removed from group membership
      for the period specified in the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes. At the end of the period,
      the object is added back to the group membership as a permanent member.

7. For inactive members, the **Membership** column displays the status as _Inactive_. The duration
   for an inactive member to remain in group membership depends on configurations made by the
   administrator.

    - The administrator can specify X number of days, say 5.

        When the status of a member is set to inactive, he/she is immediately removed from group
        membership in the directory provider. In GroupID, however, he/she remains a group member
        till the specified number of days, starting from the inactivation date. On the **Attest &
        Renew Group** wizard, the **Beginning** column displays the date when the user’s status was
        set to inactive, and the **Ending** column displays the date when the user would be removed
        from group membership in GroupID, based on the specified days.

        During this period, the member can be activated (added back to group membership). When the
        member is not activated, the Membership Life Cycle job removes it from group membership in
        GroupID too.

    - If the administrator has not specified any days, the inactivated member is removed from group
      membership in the directory provider and in GroupID when the **Attest & Renew Group** wizard
      completes. In this case, the **Beginning** and **Ending** columns remain blank.

8. Click **Next Step**.
9. The **Summary** page displays the attributes that have been updated and the members’ updated
   status.

    Click **Attest Group** to attest and renew the group.

    On attestation, the group’s expiration policy is re-applied to it, starting from today.
