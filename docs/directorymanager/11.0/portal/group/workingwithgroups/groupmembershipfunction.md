# Group Membership functions

Groups let you apply a common set of policies to multiple users. Groups also guarantee consistency
of permissions and privileges across the membership.

You can add members to groups manually, using a scheduled job, or import them from an external data
source.

## Group Membership Settings

To avoid large, unusual changes to Smart Group and Dynasty memberships, the administrator can
configure the ‘Out of Bounds’ setting for an identity store.

The administrator can:

- Specify the maximum number of members for a Smart Group and Dynasty.
- Determine actions to take if the limit is exceeded, such as not updating group membership or
  breaking the membership into smaller nested groups.

**Example:**

Let’s assume the administrator sets the maximum membership limit to 500 and opts for nested groups
when membership exceeds this limit.

**Scenario 1**: On update, 485 objects are fetched to be added to Group A’s membership. Since the
count is less than 500, the objects are directly added as group members.

**Scenario 2:** On the next update, 620 objects are fetched to be added to Group A’s membership.
Since the count exceeds 500, it breaks the membership into 2 child groups (Group 1 with 500 members
and Group 2 with 120 members) and nests them into Group A. Hence, GroupID checks the member count
and takes necessary action before adding members to the group.

:::note
An Office 365 group cannot have other groups as members. Therefore, the option to break the
membership into child groups would have the following impact:  
An Office 365 group (Group A) will be updated according to the Smart Group update process. When the
maximum membership limit is hit, the update process will create child group(s). These child groups
will exist but without any link to Group A. Hence, Group A’s membership will be empty.

## Add members to a group

You can add one or more objects to the membership of one or more groups. These objects would be
added as permanent members. You will find them listed as members on the Members tab in
[Group Properties](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/properties/overview.md).

:::note
In a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store, only user objects can be added as members of an
Office 365 group.
:::


Use any of the following methods to add members to groups.

### Method 1:

1. [Directory Search](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/generalfeatures/search.md) the required
   objects.
2. Select these objects on the **Search Results** page and click **Add to Group** on the toolbar.
3. The [Find Dialog Box](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/generalfeatures/find.md) is displayed,
   where you can search and select the group(s) to add the objects to.

### Method 2:

1. [Directory Search](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/generalfeatures/search.md) the group you
   want to add members to.
2. Select this group on the **Search Results** page and click **Properties** on the toolbar.

    The group's
    [Group Properties](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/properties/overview.md)
    page is displayed.

3. On the **Members** tab, click **Add**.
4. Enter a search string to locate the objects to add as members, or click **Advanced** to use the
   [Find Dialog Box](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/generalfeatures/find.md) for performing a
   search.
5. Save the changes.

:::note
These methods for adding members are recommended for static (unmanaged) groups only. For Smart
Groups, GroupID will discard any manual membership changes when it updates the group through the
Smart Group Update job.
:::


To add a member temporarily to a group, see
[Change the membership type of a group member ](#change-the-membership-type-of-a-group-member).

## Change the membership type of a group member

By default, all new members are added as permanent member to a group. However, you can change the
membership type of an object from permanent to temporary and vice versa.

You can also add or remove an object from a group's membership for a temporary period.

1. [Directory Search](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/generalfeatures/search.md) a group to
   change the membership type of its member(s).
2. Select this group on the **Search Results** page and click **Properties** on the toolbar.

    The group's
    [Group Properties](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/properties/overview.md)
    page is displayed, where the **Members** tab lists the group members.

3. To change the membership type of a member, click anywhere in the respective row to make it
   editable, and select one of the following options from the **Membership** list:

    - **Perpetual** - To make the object a permanent member of the group.
    - **Temporary Member** - To make the object a temporary member of the group for the period you
      specify in the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes. At the end of the period, the object is
      removed from the group membership.
    - **Addition Pending** - Indicates that the object will be a temporary member of the group for a
      period in the future. Use the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes to set a period. Before the
      beginning date, the object’s membership type is displayed as ‘Addition Pending’. On the
      beginning date, the membership type changes to ‘Temporary Member’.

        **Here is an example:**

        You add Smith as a temporary member to Group A on May 15, 2019 for future dates, May
        20-30, 2019.

        Smith will be displayed in Group A’s membership with ‘Addition Pending’ as its membership
        type from May 15 to 19, 2019. However, Smith would not be added to group membership in the
        provider.

        On May 20, Smith will become a temporary member of Group A and its membership type will
        change to ‘Temporary Member’ from May 20 to 30, 2019. Smith will also be added to group
        membership in the provider.

        After May 30, Smith will be removed from Group A as a member in GroupID and in the provider.

    - **Removal Pending** - Indicates that the object will be temporarily removed from group
      membership for a period in the future. Use the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes to set a
      period. Before the beginning date, the object’s membership type is displayed as ‘Removal
      Pending’. On the beginning date, the membership type will change to ‘Temporary Removed’.

        _Here is an example:_

        You remove Smith from Group A on May 15, 2019 for future dates, May 20-30, 2019.

        Smith will be displayed in Group A’s membership with ‘Removal Pending’ as membership type
        from May 15 to 19, 2019.

        On May 20, Smith’s membership type in GroupID will change to ‘Temporary Removed’; lasting
        till May 30, 2019. However, Smith will be removed from Group A’s membership in the provider.

        After May 30, Smith will be added back to Group A as a permanent member in GroupID and in
        the provider.

    - **Temporary Removed** - Indicates that the object is temporarily removed from group membership
      for the period specified in the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes. At the end of the period,
      the object is added back to the group membership as a permanent member.

4. Save the changes.

The Membership Life Cycle job updates the temporary membership of groups. It adds and removes
temporary members from group membership on the specified dates.

Consider a scenario where the Membership Life Cycle job is scheduled to run once a week, say
Mondays. If an object is to be added to group membership for three days - Wednesday till Friday, it
will not be added. This happens because the Membership Life Cycle job did not run on the particular
days for temporary membership update.

## Remove members permanently from a group

1. [Directory Search](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/generalfeatures/search.md) the group you
   want to remove member(s) from.

3. On the **Members** tab, select the group members you want to remove and click **Remove**.
4. Save the changes.

:::note
This method of removing members is recommended for static (unmanaged) groups only. For Smart
Groups, GroupID will discard any manual membership changes when it updates the group through the
Smart Group Update job.
