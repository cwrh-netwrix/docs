# Group properties - Delivery Restrictions tab

Use this tab to apply email restrictions to this group. You can manage the list of objects (users,
contacts, groups) from whom this group can and cannot receive emails.

By default, no object is added to the **Accept from** and **Reject from** lists, which indicates
that the group can receive emails from any object. However, when you specify an object in the
**Accept from** list, the group will receive emails from that object only.

**A scenario can be as:**

If you want the group to receive emails from all except one member (Member A) of a group (Group A),
add Group A to the Accept from list and then add Member A to the Reject from list.

**Accept from**

Shows the objects that can send emails to the group.

**Reject from**

Shows the objects whose emails will not be delivered to the group.

**Add**

To add an object to a list, click **Add** in the respective area. Enter a search string to locate
the required object, or click **Advance** to use the
[Find Dialog Box](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/generalfeatures/find.md) for performing a
search.

**Remove**

To remove an object from a list, select it and click **Remove** in the respective area.
