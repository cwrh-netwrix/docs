|              | You can view the memberships of groups that are members of this group. For example, when you add a group (Group B) as a member of this group (Group A), you can view the membership of Group B. You can continue to view memberships of groups that are members of Group B, and so on. This enables the owner of a distribution group to view all users who will receive the messages sent to the distribution group. Click the plus sign next to a member group to view its members. Group membership can be viewed up to the nth level. However, you cannot modify membership of nested groups here. For a parent Dynasty, all child Dynasties are listed as members. NOTE: For an expired security group and Office 365 group, the members list would be empty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Membership   | Indicates whether the object is a temporary or permanent member of this group. The available membership types are: <ul><li>**Perpetual**</li><li>To make the object a permanent member of the group.</li><li>**Temporary Member**</li><li>To make the object a temporary member of the group for the period you specify in the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes. At the end of the period, the object is removed from the group membership.</li><li>**Addition Pending**</li><li>Indicates that the object will be a temporary member of the group for a period in the future. Use the **Beginning** and **Ending** boxes to set a period. Before the beginning date, the object’s membership type is displayed as ‘Addition Pending’.

The Membership Life Cycle job updates the temporary membership of groups. It adds and removes
temporary members from group membership on the specified dates.

Consider a scenario where the Membership Life Cycle job is scheduled to run once a week, say
Mondays. If an object is to be added to group membership for three days - Wednesday till Friday, it
will not be added. This happens because the Membership Life Cycle job did not run on the particular
days for temporary membership update.

**Add**

To add member(s) to the group, click **Add**. Enter a search string to locate the object to add as a
member, or click **Advance** to use the
[Find Dialog Box](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/generalfeatures/find.md) for performing a
search.

The selected members get listed in the **Members** grid.

:::note
This button is disabled for Smart Groups and Dynasties since their memberships is determined
by the query set on the
[Group properties - Smart Group/Query Designer tab](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/properties/smartgroup.md).
