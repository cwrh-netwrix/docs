# Group properties - Tree View

Using the GroupID portal, you can view the hierarchy for a group. This hierarchy is displayed in the
form of a tree. For example, if Group A is a member of Group B, the graph will display group A and B
in a heirarchical form in this tab.

**Export**

You can also export the graphical representation of the group in the form of a png file.
