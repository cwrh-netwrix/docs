# Group properties - Similar Groups tab

GroupID enables you to compare groups for similarity on the basis of:

- Group type
- Membership

Take an example of a distribution group (Group A) that has 3 members; Sarah, Frank, and Robin. On
the Similar Groups tab in Group A properties, the portal displays six groups that have the strongest
similarity to Group A. To be ranked as similar to Group A, groups must be of the ‘distribution’ type
and have any or all three members that Group A has.

The six similar groups are sorted in the order of strength, with the strongest match at the top.

Click a group bar or a group in the left pane to view similarity details. The **Similarity Details**
dialog box displays the common type and common members that both groups have.
