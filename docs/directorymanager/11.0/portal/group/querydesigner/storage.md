# Query Designer - Storage tab

Settings on the Storage tab are available when the ‘Messaging System Recipients’ option is selected
in the **Find** list.

For the ‘Messaging System Recipients’ option, the default settings on the Storage tab retrieve all
mailboxes, irrespective of any server or mailbox store. You can apply a filter to mailboxes you want
the query to return.

If filters are specified, the query will return only mailboxes on the specified server or mailbox
store. This filter does not affect custom recipients, public folders, and distribution lists.

**Mailbox on any Server**

Returns all mailboxes. No filters apply with this selection.

**Mailbox on this Server**

Returns mailboxes from the server you select from the drop-down list.

**Mailbox on this MailStore**

Returns mailboxes from the mailbox store you select from the drop-down list.

**Preview**

Enables you to preview the results returned with the criteria specified on all tabs of the Query
Designer dialog box. This is a check to ensure the accuracy of data before changes are committed to
the directory.

**OK**

Saves settings and closes the dialog box.

**Cancel**

Discards settings and closes the dialog box.

**LDAP Query**

View the provider query in the LDAP Query box.
