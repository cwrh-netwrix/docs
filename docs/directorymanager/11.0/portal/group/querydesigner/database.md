# Query Designer - Database tab

You can combine an external data provider with the directory to determine a group's membership.

The supported external data providers are:

- Microsoft Access
- Microsoft Excel
- Oracle
- ODBC
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Text/CSV
- SCIM

Before using any of the above external data providers, a data source for the provider must be
defined in Admin Center. See the
[Create a Data Source](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/datasource/create.md) topic.

A connection is configured in a data source, GroupID portal connects to the external database,
retrieves the results, and then queries the directory for matching records.

You must map one column returned by the command on the Database tab with a directory attribute to
join the external data source to the identity store. The query compares the values of the mapped
attributes and extracts objects with matching values to add to the groupâ€™s membership.

For example, if you want to add to group membership all employees whose employee IDs are present in
an external data source, you can select that data source and map a key attribute with a directory
attribute. Use attributes that store the employee ID. When group membership is updated, GroupID will
fetch only those users from the directory whose employee IDs also exist in the data source.

**External Data Provider**

Select the data source from the drop-down list that you want to use to determine the group's
membership.

**External Provider Table**

Once the data source is selected, select the provider's table that contains the data.

**Identity Store Attribute**

Select an identity store attribute to map a database attribute to it.

**External Provider Attribute**

Select a data provider attribute to map it to the selected identity store attribute.

**Command String**

This field displays the command that the **Query Designer** executes to retrieve the query results
from the data source. The value can be a query statement and can include multiple columns separated
by commas. Field names are enclosed in brackets ([ ]) to prevent any ambiguity that the query engine
might encounter due to spaces between column names.

You can modify the command and even write your own command.

For better performance, it is recommended to select only the columns required to create your group.

For example:

```
SELECT [Column1],[Column2] FROM [Filename.csv]
```

Execute

Click this button to execute the command and preview the results. This process may take several
minutes depending on the size of your data source.

**Clear**

Click this button to clear the query.

**Preview**

Enables you to preview the results returned with the criteria specified on all tabs of the Query
Designer dialog box. This is a check to ensure the accuracy of data before changes are committed to
the directory.

**OK**

Saves settings and closes the dialog box.

**Cancel**

Discards settings and closes the dialog box.

**LDAP Query**
