# Query Designer - Include/Exclude tab

Use this tab to include or exclude an object from group membership, regardless of whether it is
returned by the query. The Include and Exclude lists affect group membership at two points in the
update process:

- **Immediately** - When you close the Query Designer dialog box, the GroupID portal adds the
  objects in the Include list to the group membership and removes the objects in the Exclude list
  from the group membership. If you have removed objects from the Include list, the group’s
  membership is updated immediately. However, if you have removed objects from the Exclude list, the
  group’s membership is updated only by manual update or by a scheduled job.
- **At group membership update** - When the group membership is updated using a scheduled job or the
  Update command, GroupID obtains the query results, adds the objects to include, and then removes
  the objects to exclude.

:::note
For best performance, use query criteria to include or exclude objects as opposed to
statically selecting the objects using this tab.
