# Query Designer - Script tab

This tab is read-only and displays any script that has been added for the group. The scripting
feature enables administrators to manipulate group memberships and the Query Designer dialog
attributes (except for Include and Exclude attributes).

If no script has been added for the group, the box on this tab is blank.

**Load Default Script**

Displays the script based on the query set by the user.

**Compile Script**

Compile the script to determine if there are any errors which would prevent the code from loading or
executing. While compiling your script will verify the code is free of syntactical errors, it does
not guarantee that the code is free from logical errors.

**References**

Displays the script reference. A script references file contains information about the run-time
requirements of a library or component, such as which files are needed, how they are to be
registered, and where on the host machine they should be installed.

**Preview**

Enables you to preview the results returned with the criteria specified on all tabs of the Query
Designer dialog box. This is a check to ensure the accuracy of data before changes are committed to
the directory.

**OK**

Saves settings and closes the dialog box.

**Cancel**

Discards settings and closes the dialog box.

**LDAP Query**

View the provider query in the LDAP Query box.
