# Query Designer - Password Expiry Options tab

The **Password Expiry Options** tab is only available for password expiry groups. You can create a
password expiry group by selecting the **Password Expiry** group option on the Welcome page of the
**Create Group** wizard.

A password expiry group is a Smart Group whose membership contains users whose identity store
account passwords are approaching their expiry dates. Members of this group are notified by email to
reset their passwords. On doing so, they are automatically removed from group membership.

On the **Password Expiry Options** tab of the Query Designer, you can define the password expiry
policy for the group. Based on this policy and the users' PWDLASTSET attribute, GroupID creates this
group with users whose passwords will soon expire.

When the group is updated, GroupID will add/remove users from the group and send email notifications
to all members.

You can also include disabled users and users whose password never expire to the password expiry
group.

## Domain Expiration Policy

Specify the maximum password age. The default age is 42 days. This setting does not affect your
domain security settings on the directory server.

## Expiration Range Policy

This policy defines when the user is added in the password expiry group. For example, take a domain
security policy configured with a maximum password age of 30 days. Setting the expiration range
policy to 10 days includes users who have passwords aged 20 days or older in the password expiry
group.

### Include disabled users

Select this check box to include disabled user accounts in the new group.

### Include users whose password never expires

Select this check box to include users with the **Password never expires** setting enabled, in group
membership.

## Send email after update

Select this check box to send a password expiry warning email to group members each time group
membership is updated either manually or through a scheduled job.

This email contains a URL that redirects users to a Password Center portal for changing their
identity store account passwords. (The administrator specifies this URL while configuring an SMTP
server for the identity store.)

The **Send email after update** options is enabled after the group is created.

Warning emails are not sent to group members (users) whose passwords are set to 'never expire'. Such
users are included in group membership when you select the **Include users whose password never
expires** check box or add such users to the **Include** list on the
[Query Designer - Include/Exclude tab](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/querydesigner/includeexclude.md).

For warning emails to be sent, you must have an SMTP server configured for the identity store.

## Preview

Use this button to preview results obtained with the current settings on all tabs of the **Query
Designer** dialog box. This is a check to ensure the accuracy of data before changes are committed
to the directory. On clicking it, results are displayed on the following two tabs at the bottom of
the dialog box:

- Directory tab: displays the results for all the options set on all the tabs of the Query Designer
  dialog box.
- Advanced tab: displays the results from the selected external data source when you click the
  Execute button on the Advanced tab of the dialog box.

## Display preferences

The attributes of the objects displayed on the **Directory** and **Advanced** tabs are set using the
context (right-click) menu of each column header on the tab. Options are:

| Column header's context menu option | Description                                                                                                                                                   |

| Size All Columns to Fit             | Set the column size of each column to fit its content.                                                                                                        |
| `<Attribute Name>`                  | The names of the attributes currently displayed on the tab. Clear the check box for an attribute to remove it from the **Directory** tab.                     |
| **More**                            | Select additional attributes to display on the tab. After adding attributes, re-launch the **Directory** tab to refresh the list of the attributes displayed. |

In addition to the column header display options, the **Directory** tab also provides object display
options that are available when you right-click an object. Options are:

| Object's Context Menu Option | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add to Exclude               | Add the object to the Exclude list so that it cannot be added to the group's membership.                                                                                         |
| Export                       | Export the selected object's information to a comma-separated value (csv) or XML file. The export action exports only the attributes displayed on the tab.                       |
| Export All                   | Export the information of all objects on the **Directory** tab to a comma-separated value (csv) or XML file. The export action exports only the attributes displayed on the tab. |
