# Dynasties

A [Dynasty](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/dynasty/overview.md)is a Smart Group
that creates and manages other Smart Groups using information in the directory. This view lists only
the Dynasties created in GroupID in the connected identity store, and does not include expired and
deleted Dynasties.

The **Type** column shows whether a Dynasty is a parent, middle, or leaf Dynasty. Both middle and
leaf Dynasties are child Dynasties. The parent Dynasty comes at the top of the hierarchy, followed
by middle and then leaf Dynasties.

Dynasty names help you group a parent Dynasty with its respective child Dynasties.

- For a Geographical/Organizational/Custom Dynasty - The name of a child Dynasty starts with the
  name of its parent Dynasty (unless you change the naming template for Dynasty children).
- For a Managerial Dynasty - By default, the naming template for its child Dynasties starts with
  "Direct reports of `<manager>`".
