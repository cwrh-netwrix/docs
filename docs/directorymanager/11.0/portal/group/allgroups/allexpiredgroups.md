# Expired Groups

This page lists expired groups. A group expires when:

- Its validity period, as defined in its expiration policy, ends.

**OR**

- The administrator manually designates a group as expired.

Expired groups are locked for all activities until renewed.

You can
[Modify Search Directory](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/allgroups/allgroups.md#modify-search-directory)
to search expired groups and add
[Filter All Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/group/allgroups/allgroups.md#filter-all-groups)
by clicking **Expired Group Grid Filters**. All the expired groups matching the filters will be
displayed.
