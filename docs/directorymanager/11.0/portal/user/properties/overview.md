# User Properties

You can view and manipulate the properties of directory objects (users, mailboxes, and contacts) in
the connected identity store, depending on the permissions the GroupID administrator has granted
you.

**You can:**

- Select the required object and click **Properties** on the toolbar. The object's properties page
  is displayed.
- Click **Save** after making any changes in any properties' tab
- Click **Delete** to delete that user, contact, or mailbox.
- Click **Add to Contacts** on the toolbar. The portal creates the direct report's vCard and prompts
  you to save it on your machine. You can then use it to add the direct report's email address to
  your email contact list.
- Click **Send email** on the toolbar. This launches the default Windows email application for
  sending an email to the direct report.
- Click Reset Password to reset the password for the object.
- Click **Organizational Hierarchy** to view the hierarchy of the object.
