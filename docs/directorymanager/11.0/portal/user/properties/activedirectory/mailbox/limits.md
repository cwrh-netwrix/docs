This tab applies to mailboxes only. It allows you to set the storage quota for the object's mailbox,
such as an Exchange mailbox.

**Use default storage quota**

Select this check box to use the default quota for the mailbox store instead of defining it
individually.

**Issue warning (K)**

The mailbox size in kilobytes (KB) for this user, that, when exceeded, triggers an over-limit
warning. However, the user can still send and receive messages.

**Prohibit Send (K)**

The maximum mailbox size in kilobytes (KB) for this user, that, when exceeded, suspends the user's
ability to send emails.

**Prohibit Send/Receive (K)**

The maximum mailbox size, in kilobytes (KB) for this user, that, when exceeded, suspends the user's
ability to both send and receive emails.
