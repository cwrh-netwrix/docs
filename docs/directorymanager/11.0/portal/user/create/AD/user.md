# Create an AD User

In GroupID portal, you can create mail-enabled and non mail-enabled users.

:::note
In a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store, users can only be created as non mail-enabled.
Create a mailbox as an alternative to a mail-enabled user.
:::


:::note
Pages and fields on the Create User wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the
administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.

## Create a mail-enabled user in Active Directory

1. In the GroupID portal, click the **Create New** button in the left pane and select **User**.

    The **Create User** wizard opens to the Account page.

2. On the
   [Account page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/create/AD/account.md),
   specify basic account info, such as the user's first name, last name, login ID and the UPN
   suffix.
3. On the
   [Password page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/create/AD/password.md),
   provide a password for the user account and set other password-specific options.
4. Use the
   [Exchange page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/create/AD/messaging.md),
   to create the user as mail-enabled.
5. On the
   [Summary Page](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/create/AD/summary.md),
   review the settings and then click Finish to complete the wizard.

:::note
If the GroupID administrator has specified the user creation action for review, your changes
will not take effect until verified by an approver. See the
[Requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/request/overview.md) topic.

   remaining fields on the page.

    A non mail-enabled user does not have an email address.
