# Create a Microsoft Entra ID User

In GroupID portal, you can create mail-enabled and non mail-enabled users.

NOTE: In a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store, users can only be created as non mail-enabled.
Create a mailbox as an alternative to a mail-enabled user.

NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create User wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the
administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.

## Create a user in Microsoft Entra ID

1. In the GroupID portal, click the **Create New** button in the left pane and select **User**.

    The **Create User** wizard opens to the Account page.

2. On the **Account** page, specify basic account info, such as the user's first name, last name,
   login ID and the UPN suffix.
3. On the **Password** page, provide a password for the user account and set other password-specific
   options.
4. Use the **Directory Roles** page to assign a role and role privileges to the user on the
   Microsoft Entra Admin Center portal.
5. On the **Summary** page, review the settings and then click Finish to complete the wizard.

NOTE: If the GroupID administrator has specified the user creation action for review, your changes
will not take effect until verified by an approver. See the
[Requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/request/overview.md) topic.
