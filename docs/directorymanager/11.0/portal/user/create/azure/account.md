# Account page

Use this page to specify basic account info, such as the user's first name, last name, login ID and
the UPN suffix.

1. Click **Browse** next to the **Container** box to select a container to create the user in.
2. Enter the user's first name and last name in the respective boxes.
3. The wizard uses the provided information to populate the **Display Name** and **User logon name**
   boxes. You can modify this information, if required.

    The logon name is the user ID the user will use to log into the identity store.

4. The **UPN Suffix** box displays the UPN suffix for the user account. This is the name of the
   domain the identity store is running on. An example of a UPN suffix can be 'mydomain.com'.

    When a domain user account is created, the complete domain account comprises of a user logon
    name followed by '@' and then the domain name.

5. Click **Next**.
