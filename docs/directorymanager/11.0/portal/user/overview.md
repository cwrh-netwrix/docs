# User Management

With GroupID, you can:

- Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning in bulk. See the
  [Synchronize](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/synchronize/overview.md) section.
- Establish ownership by defining a clear managerial hierarchy with dotted line management. See the
  [Dotted line management](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/properties/activedirectory/useroverview/organization.md#dotted-line-management)
  section of the
  [Object properties - Organization tab](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/properties/activedirectory/useroverview/organization.md)
  topic.
- Delegate user management to end users by enabling them to:

    - Create and manage users, contacts, and mailboxes in the directory. See the
      [ Create User Objects](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/create/overview.md)
      topic.
    - Manage their direct reports. See the
      [Update your Direct Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/manage/directreport.md)
      topic.
    - Update their profiles in the directory. See the
      [Validate your profile](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/manage/validateprofile.md)
      topic.

- Link identical users in different directory services, such as Active Directory and Microsoft Entra
  ID. See the [Linked Accounts](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/portal/user/linkedaccounts.md)
  topic.

The table below displays the major functions that users can perform in GroupID portal.
