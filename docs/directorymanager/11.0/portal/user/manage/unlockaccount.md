# Unlock your accounts

With the GroupID portal, you can unlock your identity store account yourself, without having to
contact the administrator or wait.

Your account can get locked due to:

1. **Wrong password attempts while logging on to the portal**
    - the consecutive number of times a user can provide the wrong password (Account lockout
      threshold), after which the user's identity store account gets locked.
    - the duration to lock the user account (_Account lockout duration_).
2. **Invalid response to authentication type(s)**

    The GroupID Administrator can specify Password Policy for the identity store, which includes:

    - the consecutive number of times a role member can provide a wrong value for any authentication
      type (Failed Authentication Attempts Threshold).
    - the duration to lock the user account (_Account Lockout duration_).

With authentication disabled, you cannot authenticate yourself on the GroupID portal; hence, you
cannot unlock your identity store accounts or reset your passwords until the account is unlocked.

What do you want to do?

- Unlock Identity Store User Accounts after Wrong Password Attempts (Enrolled Users)
- Unlock Identity Store User Accounts after Wrong Password Attempts (Unenrolled Users)
- Unlock Identity Store User Accounts after Providing Wrong Response to Authentication Types
  (Enrolled and Unenrolled Users)
