## History view modes

History data is available in two modes:

Displays history data in a descriptive and user-friendly manner. Items are sorted according to the
date and time of modification, showing the most recent at the top.

This is the default view of history data.

### Administrative view

This view is only available if you have administrative privileges.

Click **Switch to Administrative View** to view history data in administrative mode. It displays
history data in a tabular form. History items are grouped by date. Each date group displays changes
made to directory objects during that period.

You can expand an item to view more details, such as the names of the attributes modified in an
action along with their old and new values.

## Filter history data

1. Click **My History Grid Filter** to specify a criteria for filtering history data.
2. Click **Add Filter** to add the filter criteria.
3. From the **Select a filter** list, select attributes to filter history data on the basis of the
   attribute modified.
4. Two more boxes get displayed next to **Select a filter** box upon selecting a filter.

    - **Select an Operator**: Select an operator from the first list.
    - **Select a Value**: Specify a value for the selected operator in the second box.

    For example, if you select '_Modified on_' from the first list, _'is exactly_' from the second
    list, and specify a date in the third box, then history items that were modified on the
    specified date will be displayed.

5. Click **Apply Filter**.

    History items that match the specified criteria are displayed.

6. Click **Reset Filter** to remove all the filters.
