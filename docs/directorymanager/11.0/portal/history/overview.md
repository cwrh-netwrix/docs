# History

The GroupIDÂ portal maintains a log of actions when objects are created, modified, and deleted in the
portal provided that the GroupID administrator has enabled history tracking for the identity store.
GroupID portal also tracks all actions that are committed to the directory using:

- GroupID Management Shell cmdlets

- GroupID mobile app

- GroupID APIs

The administrator can configure the following for history tracking:

- track all or specific events
- retain history data forever or for a specified duration

Therefore, history data represents only the events that history-tracking is configured to track.
Furthermore, if history-tracking is not enabled or has been recently disabled for the identity
store, the portal does not display history data or it displays data that was logged before
history-tracking was turned off.

A user can add a note to a history action that he/she performed. Other users can just view that
note. This note may explain the reason for performing that action. See the
[Configure History Tracking](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/configure/historytracking.md)
topic.
