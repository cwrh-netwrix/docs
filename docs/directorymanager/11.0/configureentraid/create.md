# Microsoft Entra ID Identity Store

Once you have registered GroupID and created a user with required directory role in Microsoft Entra
ID, you can now create an Microsoft Entra ID identity store in GroupID. This topic walks you through
the steps to create an Microsoft Entra ID identity store and assign a role to the Microsoft Entra ID
user in GroupID.

## To create an Microsoft Entra ID Identity Store

See the
[Create an Identity Store for Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/admincenter/identitystore/create.md#create-an-identity-store-for-microsoft-entra-id)
topic for creating an Microsoft Entra ID identity store.

:::note
If you intend to use a service account user with Global Administrator directory role, then no
change is required in the default GroupID security roles settings of Microsoft Entra ID identity
store. And if you intend to use a service account user with any role, other than Global
administrator directory role (i.e. User Administrator + Exchange Administrator), then the GroupID
Administrator security role criteria group must be changed to User Account Administrator.
:::


## GroupID Security Role Setting

If you want to use a service account user with a role other than Global administrator role for
Microsoft Entra ID identity store, you have to assign it _User Account Administrator_ role in
GroupID.

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for Microsoft Entra ID identity store
   and select **Edit**.
3. Click **Security Roles** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Edit** for the administrator security role.
5. On the **Edit Security Role** page, the **Criteria** area displays the role criteria. Click **Add
   Criteria** to change it. On the **Add Criteria** dialog box, delete the existing criteria and
   search for User account administrator. Click **Save**.
6. Click **Update Security Role**.
7. On the **Security Roles** page, click **Save**.

## Limitations of Minimum Service Account Permissions

If you are using a service account with minimum directory role assignments, the following
limitations apply:

- Only the User role can be assigned to newly created users and mailboxes objects from GroupID. The
  same applies to existing users and mailboxes, as Directory Roles cannot be changed, using a
  service account with minimum directory role assignments.

- The password reset functionality would be limited to objects falling in the User role, User
  Administrator role, and Helpdesk role.
