Each policy must have a unique name. To change the name of a policy, type the new name in the text
box.

Enter any **Notes** about the policy

Select the **Default characters set**. The default value (Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer) requires
users to comply with rules that use the Password Policy Enforcer character set. Choose the alternate
option (Windows) to have users comply with rules that use the Windows character set.

**NOTE:** Only Password Policy Enforcer 10.0 and higher contain the Windows character set. Password
Policy Enforcer 9, Netwrix Password Reset and Password Policy Enforcer/Web 7 (and older for all
products) always use the Password Policy Enforcer character set.

- Some languages such as Japanese do not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase. These
  characters are in the Windows Alpha set, but not in the Upper or Lower sets.
- Characters classified as a space, punctuation, control or blank by Windows are included in the
  Special character set. If these characters are also included in some other set by Windows (for
  example, a superscript one is both a decimal digit and punctuation), then Password Policy Enforcer
  only includes them in the Special character set when the Windows character set is selected.
- When using the Password Policy Enforcer character set, all characters above ANSI 126 are included
  in the High set. When using the Windows character set, a character is only included in the High
  set if it is above ANSI 126 and not included in any other set by Windows.

Select the number of rules for **Passwords must comply with** from the drop-down list to specifiy
the required compliance level for this policy. The default value **(all the rules**) requires users
to comply with all enabled rules. Choose an alternative option if Password Policy Enforcer should
enforce a more lenient password policy. The Minimum Age and Maximum Age rules are excluded from
compliance level calculations. See the [Rules](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.0/administration/rules.md) topic for additional information.

When setting the compliance level, consider that some rules may be disabled when a user enters a
passphrase. See the [Passphrase](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.0/administration/passphrases.md) topic for additional information. Password Policy
Enforcer accepts passphrases that comply with all enabled rules, irrespective of the compliance
level. This ensures that passphrases can be used, even if they do not meet the compliance level when
Password Policy Enforcer is configured to disable one or more rules for passphrases.

Password Policy Enforcer can start a password synchronization application or script whenever a user
successfully changes their password. Enter the full path to the executable in the **Execute the
program when password is changed** text box. The path can contain environment variables like
`%SystemRoot%`. Every computer running Password Policy Enforcer should have a local copy of the
program, and only authorized users should have access to it, or any of its components.

The user logon name and new password are sent to the program as command-line parameters. For
example, if you add the commands below to a batch file, Password Policy Enforcer records each user's
logon name and new password in a text file named **passwords.txt**:

echo Username: %1 >> c:\passwords.txt

echo Password: %2 >> c:\passwords.txt

**CAUTION:** This script is shown as an example only. You should not store user passwords.

The command can now include the [USERNAME] and [PASSWORD] macros. If neither is specified, then the
command is executed with both parameters to maintain compatibility with existing programs/scripts.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Use the [USERNAME] parameter if the password is not needed by the program/script
so that the password is not unnecessarily sent to the change notification command/script.
