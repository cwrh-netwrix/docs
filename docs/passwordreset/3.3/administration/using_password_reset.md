# Using Password Reset

Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer is a web application. Users can access it from a web browser, or
from the Password Reset Client. The default URL for the Web Interface
is:` http://[server]/pwreset/`  
See the [Password Reset Client](/docs/passwordreset/3.3/administration/password_reset_client.md) topic for more information.

You can use URL parameters to open a specific page, and to set the user and domain names. For
example: `http://[server]/pwreset/apr.dll? cmd=enroll&username=johnsmith&domain=CORP`

Where [server] is the name or IP address of the server hosting the Web Interface.

Users access the Enroll, Reset, Unlock, and Change features from the menu. These features are
explained on the following pages.

**CAUTION:** The connection between the Web Interface and Password Reset Server is always encrypted.
Install an SSL certificate on the web server and use HTTPS to encrypt connections from the browser
to the web server. See the
[Installing and Using an SSL Certificate](securing_password_reset.md#installing-and-using-an-ssl-certificate)
topic for more information.

## Enroll

Only enrolled users can reset their password and unlock their account. Users can enroll manually by
answering some questions about themselves, or they can be enrolled automatically if automatic
enrollment is enabled. Users only need to enroll once, but they can enroll again if they are locked
out of Password Reset, or if they want to change their questions or answers. See the
[Verification Codes](verification_tab.md#verification-codes) and
[Verification Tab](/docs/passwordreset/3.3/administration/verification_tab.md) topics for more information.

## Error Messages

Validation errors are shown in a red box below the page instructions. Validation errors are normally
caused by invalid user input. They can often be overcome by changing the value of one or more input
fields and resubmitting the form.

![using_npr_12](/img/product_docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.0/passwordreset/administration/using_npr_12.webp)

Critical errors are shown on their own page. These errors are mostly a result of configuration or
system errors. An event may be written to the Windows Application event log on the Password Reset
Server computer when a critical error occurs. Users can sometimes overcome a critical error by
following the instructions in the error message, but most critical errors are beyond the user's
control.

![using_npr_13](/img/product_docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.0/passwordreset/administration/using_npr_13.webp)

Validation and critical error messages are stored in the HTML templates. You can modify the default
messages by editing the templates. See the
[Resource Strings](editing_the_html_templates.md#resource-strings) topic for more information.
