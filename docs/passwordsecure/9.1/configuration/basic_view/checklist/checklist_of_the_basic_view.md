# Checklist of the Basic view

## Checklist for setting the Basic view

This checklist helps the administrator in setting the Basic view. To work smoothly with the Basic
view, the following points must be observed:

1. Select form

The stored form must cover all required field types. At least required: **Text, username, password,
URL**

2. Set display of the Basic view or Advanced view

The setting **Display passwords in Basic view & display passwords in Advanced view** allows you to
configure the display of both clients. The passwords can be displayed with an icon, logo or in text
form.

3. Are users in the right organisational unit?

Check if the user is in the correct organisational unit. The **add** right to the organisational
unit is also required so that users can create passwords in the Basic view.

4. Define user as Basic view user

You can either define the user directly as Basic view user. This works by changing the user type
accordingly. Alternatively, you can activate the setting **Start Basic view at next login.** This
will prompt the user to log in to the Basic view.

5. Add default applications (optional)

It is advised to create the applications, which shall be stored as passwords, beforehand.
