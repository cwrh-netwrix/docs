# File-Based Repository for Long-Term Archive

Long-Term Archive is a file-based repository for keeping activity records collected by Auditor.

## Location

Long-Term Archive can be located on the same computer with Auditor Server, or separately - in this
case ensure that the Auditor Server can access the remote machine. By default, the Long-Term Archive
(repository) and Auditor working folder are stored on the system drive. Default path to the
Long-Term Archive is `%ProgramData%\NetwrixAuditor\Data`.

To reduce the impact on the system drive in large and extra-large environments, it is recommended to
move Long-Term Archive to another disk. For that, you should estimate the required capacity using
recommendations in the next section.

Then you should prepare the new folder for repository, target Netwrix Auditor at that folder, and,
if necessary, move repository data from the old to the new location.

Follow the steps to modify Long-Term Archive location and other settings.

**Step 1 –** In Auditor client, click Settings > Long-Term Archive; alternatively, if you are
viewing the Long-Term Archive widget of the Health Status dashboard, click Open settings.

**Step 2 –** Click Modify.

**Step 3 –** Enter new path or browse for the required folder.

**Step 4 –** Provide retention settings and access credentials.

**Step 5 –** To move data from the old repository to the new location, take the steps described in
the following Netwrix knowledge base article:
[How to Move Long-Term Archive to a New Location](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA00g000000H9SSCA0.html).

Auditor client will start writing data to the new location right after you complete data moving
procedure.

## Retention

Default retention period for repository data is **120 months**. You can specify the value you need
in the Long-Term Archive settings. When retention period is over, data will be deleted
automatically.

If the retention period is set to **0**, the following logic will be applied:

- **Audit data for SQL Server, file servers, Windows Server:** only data stored by the last **2**
  data collection sessions will be preserved.
- **User activity data:** only data stored by the last **7** data collection sessions will be
  preserved.
- **Other data sources:** only data stored by the last **4** data collection sessions will be
  preserved.

## Capacity

To examine the repository capacity and daily growth, use the Long-Term Archive Capacity of the
Health Status dashboard.

To estimate the amount of activity records collected and stored to the repository day by day, use
the [Activity Records Statistics](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/healthstatus/dashboard/activityrecordstatistics.md)
widget. Click View details to see how many activity records were produced by each data source,
collected and saved to the Long-Term Archive and to the database.

Netwrix Auditor will inform you if you are running out of space on a system disk where the
repository is stored by default — you will see this information in the Health Status dashboard, in
the health summary email, and also in the events in the Netwrix Auditor health log.

When free disk space is less than **3 GB**, the Netwrix services responsible for audit data
collection will be stopped.

## Configure Long-Term Archive Account

An account used to write data to the Long-term Archive and upload report subscriptions to shared
folders. By default, the LocalSystem account is used for the archive stored locally and the computer
account is used for archive stored on a file share.

If you want to store the Long-term Archive on a file share, you can specify custom account in
Settings>**Long-Term Archive** in Auditor.

Starting with version 9.96, you can use Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) as the account for
accessing Long-term Archive.

The custom account must be granted the following rights and permissions:

- Advanced permissions on the folder where the Long-term Archive is stored:
    - List folder / read data
    - Read attributes
    - Read extended attributes
    - Create files / write data
    - Create folders / append data
    - Write attributes
    - Write extended attributes
    - Delete subfolders and files
    - Read permissions
- On the file shares where report subscriptions are saved:

    - Change share permission
    - Create files / write data folder permission

    Subscriptions created in the Auditor client  are uploaded to file servers under the Long-Term
    Archive service account as well. See the [Subscriptions](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/subscriptions/overview.md)
    topic for additional information.

- Specify a Netwrix Auditor user as principal.
- Set Type to _"Allow"_.
- Set Applies to to _"This folder, subfolders and files"_.
- Check Create files / write data in the Advanced permissions section.

The users who are going to access report subscriptions must be granted read access to these shares.
Netwrix recommends you to create a dedicated folder and grant access to the entire Netwrix Auditor

## System Health

Long-Term Archive is a file-based storage where Auditor saves the collected activity records. By
default, it is located on the system drive at `%PROGRAMDATA%\Netwrix Auditor\Data` and keeps data
for 120 months. You may want to modify these settings, for example, move the storage from the system
drive to another location. The Long-Term Archive widget will help you to monitor the Long-Term
Archive capacity. The widget displays the current size and daily increase of the Long-Term Archive,
and the remaining free space on the target drive.

To open the Long-Term Archive settings, click the corresponding link. Then you will be able to
adjust the settings as necessary. See the [Long-Term Archive](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/settings/longtermarchive.md)
topic for additional information.
