# Permissions for Exchange Auditing

Before creating a monitoring plan to audit your Exchange server, you need to plan for the account
that will be used for data collection. This account should meet the requirements listed below. You
will specify this account in the monitoring plan wizard (or in the monitored item settings).

## Account Requirements

The account used for data collection must meet the following requirements:

- Member of the Domain Admins group on the target server.

    **NOTE:** This covers all the required permissions below and is a mandatory setting if you want
    to use network traffic compression for data collection.

    OR

- The combination of the following rights and permissions if you plan to disable network traffic
  compression for your monitoring plan or, for some reasons, do not want to add this account to the
  Domain Admins group:

    - The Manage auditing and security log policy must be defined for this account. See the
      [Permissions for Active Directory Auditing](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/activedirectory/permissions.md) topic for
      additional information.
    - If you plan to process the Active Directory Deleted Objects container, Read permission on this
      container is required. See the
      [Permissions for Active Directory Auditing](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/activedirectory/permissions.md) topic for
      additional information.
    - The account must belong to the Organization Management or Records Management group. See the
      Add Account to the Organization Management Group topic for additional information.
    - Several management roles assigned: Audit Logs role, View-only Configuration role, Mail
      Recipients role, and Monitoring role. See the Add Account to the Organization Management Group
      topic for additional information on how to perform role assignment.
    - Additional configuration if auto-backup is _enabled_ for the domain controller event logs (see
      below).

## Additional Configuration for Domain Controller's Event Logs Auto-backup

The following is required if auto-backup is _enabled_ for the domain controller event logs:

- Permissions to access the _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Security_
  registry key on the domain controllers in the target domain. See the Assign Permission to Read the
  Registry Key topic for additional information.
- Membership in one of the following groups: Administrators, Print Operators, Server Operators
- Read/Write share permission and Full control security permission on the logs backup folder

## Add Account to the Organization Management Group

Follow the steps to add account to the Organization Management group.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to **Start > Active Directory Users and Computers** on any domain controller
in the root domain of the forest where Microsoft Exchange 2019, 2016, or 2013 is installed.

**Step 2 –** In the left pane, navigate to **`<domain_name>` > Microsoft Exchange Security Groups**.

**Step 3 –** On the right, locate the **Organization Management** group and double-click it.

**Step 4 –** In the **Organization Management Properties** dialog that opens, select the **Members**
tab and click **Add**.

If for some reason you do not want this account to belong to the Organization Management group, you
can add it to the Records Management group in the same way. The Records Management group is less
powerful, and accounts belonging to it have fewer rights and permissions.

## Assign Management Roles

Perform this procedure only if the account selected for data collection is not a member of the
**Organization Management** or the **Records Management** group.

Follow the steps to assign management roles.

**Step 1 –** On the computer where Microsoft Exchange 2019, 2016, 2013 or is installed, open the
**Exchange Management Shell** under an account that belongs to the **Organization Management**
group.

**Step 2 –** Use the following syntax to assign the required management role to a user:

New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name `<assignment name>` -User `<UserName>` -Role `<role name>`

For example:

New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name "AuditLogsNetwrixRole" -User Corp\\jsmith -Role "Audit Logs"

In this example, the user _CORP\jsmith_ has been assigned the **Audit Logs** role.

## Assign Permission to Read the Registry Key

This permission is required only if the account selected for data collection is not a member of the
Domain Admins group.

This permission should be assigned on each domain controller in the audited domain, so if your
domain contains multiple domain controllers, it is recommended to assign permissions through Group
Policy, or automatically using
[Audit Configuration Assistant](/docs/auditor/10.8/tools/auditconfigurationassistant.md).

To assign permissions manually, use the Registry Editor snap-in or the Group Policy Management
console.

### Assign Permission Via the Registry Editor Snap-in

Follow the steps to assign permission via the Registry Editor snap-in.

**Step 1 –** On your target server, open Registry Editor: navigate to **Start > Run** and type
_"regedit"_.

**Step 2 –** In the left pane, navigate to _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControl
Set\Services\EventLog\Security_.

**Step 3 –** Right-click the **Security** node and select **Permissions** from the pop-up menu.

**Step 4 –** Click **Add** and enter the name of the user that you want to grant permissions to.

**Step 5 –** Check **Allow** next to the **Read** permission.

**Step 6 –** For auditing Logon Activity, you also need to assign the Read permission to the
_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\PolAdtEv_ registry key.

### Assign Permission Using the Group Policy Management Console

Follow the steps to assign permission using the Group Policy Management console.

**Step 1 –** Open the Group Policy Management console on any domain controller in the target domain:
navigate to Start > Windows Administrative Tools (Windows Server 2016/2019) or Administrative Tools
(Windows 2012 R2 and below) > Group Policy Management.

**Step 2 –** In the left pane, navigate to Forest: `<forest name>` > Domains > `<domain name>` >
Domain Controllers. Right-click the effective domain controllers policy (by default, it is the
_Default Domain Controllers Policy_), and select Edit .

**Step 3 –** In the Group Policy Management Editor dialog, expand the Computer Configuration node on
the left and navigate to Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Registry.

**Step 4 –** Right-click in the pane and select Add Key.

**Step 5 –** Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\PolAdtEv` and click OK.

**Step 6 –** Click Add and enter the name of the user that you want to grant permissions to and
press Enter.

**Step 7 –** Check Allow next to the _"Read"_ permission and click OK

**Step 8 –** In the pop-up window, select Propagate inheritable permissions to all subkeys and click
OK.

**Step 9 –** Repeat the steps 4-8 for keys below:

- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurePipeServers\winreg`;
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Security`.

**Step 10 –** Close Group Policy Management console.

**Step 11 –** Navigate to Start > Run and type "_cmd_". Input the `gpupdate /force` command and
press Enter. The group policy will be updated.

**Step 12 –** Type `repadmin /syncall` command and press Enter for replicate GPO changes to other
domain controllers.

**Step 13 –** Ensure that new GPO settings were applied to the domain controllers.
