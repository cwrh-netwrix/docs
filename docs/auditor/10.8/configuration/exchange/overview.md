# Exchange

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and
access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment
and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling
certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data
integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See
the
[Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html)
knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

- Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to
  automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be
  checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.
- Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and
  reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or
  configure them manually:

    - In the Exchange environment:

        - Install the ADSI Edit utility to the server from which configuration is performed if it is
          not a domain controller
        - The following policies must be set to _"Success"_ for the effective domain controllers
          policy:

            - Audit account management
            - Audit directory service access

        - The Audit logon events policy must be set to _"Success"_ (or _"Success"_ and "_Failure"_)
          for the effective domain controllers policy.
        - The Advanced audit policy settings can be configured instead of basic.
        - The Maximum Security event log size must be set to 4GB. The retention method of the
          Security event log must be set to _“Overwrite events as needed.”_
        - Auto archiving must be enabled to prevent audit data loss if log overwrites occur.
        - The Object-level audit settings must be configured for the Domain, Configuration and
          Schema partitions.
        - The AD tombstoneLifetime attribute must be set to _"730"_.
        - If you have an on-premises Exchange server 2019, 2016, 2013 or 2010 in your Active
          Directory domain, consider that some changes can be made via that Exchange server. To be
          able to audit and report who made those changes, you should configure the Exchange
          Administrator Audit Logging (AAL) settings, as described in the
          [Exchange Administrator Audit Logging Settings](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/exchange/auditlog.md) topic.
        - The Administrator Audit Logging settings must be configured (only required for Exchange
          2019, 2016, 2013 or 2010). See the
          [Exchange Administrator Audit Logging Settings](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/exchange/auditlog.md) topic for additional
          information.
        - In order to audit mailbox access, native audit logging must be enabled for user, shared,
          equipment, linked, and room mailboxes:

            - Access types: administrator , delegate user
            - Actions: Update, Move, MoveToDeletedItems, SoftDelete, HardDelete, FolderBind, SendAs,
              SendOnBehalf, Create

        - If you want to track non-owner access, configure mailbox monitoring. See the
          [Configure Exchange for Monitoring Mailbox Access](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/exchange/mailboxacccess.md) topic for additional
          information.

    - On the Auditor console computer:

        - If you have enabled automatic log backup for the Security log of your domain controller,
          you can instruct Auditor to clear the old backups automatically. For that, use the
          **CleanAutoBackupLogs** registry key, as described in the
          [Active Directory Registry Key Configuration](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/activedirectory/registrykey.md) topic.

            **_RECOMMENDED:_** Adjust retention period for the backup files accordingly (default is
            **50** hours). See the
            [Adjust Security Event Log Size and Retention](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/activedirectory/securitylog.md) topic.

        - To provide for event data collection, the Secondary Logon service must be up and running .
          Open **Administrative Tools** > **Services**, right-click the **Secondary Logon** service
          and on the **General** tab make sure that Startup type for this service is other than
          _Disabled_.

_Remember,_ for Exchange auditing, do the following:

1. Configure Data Collecting Account, as described in the
   [Data Collecting Account](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/dataaccounts.md) topic.
2. Configure required protocols and ports, as described in the [Exchange Ports](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/exchange/ports.md) topic.

## Monitored Object Types, Actions, and Attributes

Netwrix Auditor tracks changes that have been made to all Exchange server object classes and
attributes. The list of Exchange object classes is version-dependent.
