Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and
access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment
and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling
certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data
integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See
the
[Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html)
knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure yourÂ IT Infrastructure for monitoring automatically through a monitoring plan. No
manual configurations are required.

## Users and groups

Starting with the version 10.5, Netwrix Auditor for VMware collects data on VMware users and groups.

To audit users and groups, vCenter 6.5 and above required.

The following objects are monitored:

- vCenter Single Sign-On (SSO) Users. The product collects data from vCenter.
- Localos users. For these users, the product collects data from ESXi and vCenter.

    the Who value is reported as _âNot Applicableâ_ for the localos users if the data was collected
    from the entire vCenter.

- VMware groups. The product collects data from vCenter.

| Object type  | Actions                      | Attributes                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| SSO User     | - Added - Modified - Removed | - Description - Email - FullName - Disabled       |
| Localos user | - Added - Modified - Removed | - Disabled - FullName - Locked - Member Of - Name |
| Group        | - Added - Modified - Removed | - Member - Description                            |

Netwrix Auditor may report on several changes with _who_ reported as _system_ due to the native
VMware audit peculiarities

## Considerations and Limitations

The following considerations refer to VMware infrastructure monitoring with Netwrix Auditor:

- A VM that was moved from one resource pool to another (within the same VMware host) will be
  reported as _Modified_.
- If an ESXi host was specified as a monitored item in the corresponding monitoring plan, but a
  virtual machine was created using the vCenter Server (not this ESXi host) management facilities,
  information about this VM creation will not be collected. To work around, specify the vCenter
  Server as a monitored item in the monitoring plan.
- For ESXi host permission changes, the "What" field in the Activity Records (and, therefore,
  reports and search results) will report _\root_.
- Netwrix Auditor will not collect data on _Failed Logon_ event in case of incorrect logon attempt
  through VMware vCenter Single Sign-On.
- Also, data on the logon attempts performed using SSH will not be collected.
- For custom role creation event, initiator will be reported as _System_.
