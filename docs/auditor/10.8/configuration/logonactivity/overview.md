# Logon Activity

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and
access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment
and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling
certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data
integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See
the
[Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html)
knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

- Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to
  automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be
  checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.

    - For both new and existing monitoring plans, you can click **Launch Audit Configuration
      Assistant** (in the wizard step or in the plan settings, respectively) to launch a special
      tool that can detect current infrastructure settings and adjust them as needed for monitoring.
      See the [Audit Configuration Assistant](/docs/auditor/10.8/tools/auditconfigurationassistant.md) topic for
      additional information.

- Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and
  reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or
  configure them manually:

    - The following policies must be set to _"Success"_ and _"Failure"_ for the effective domain
      controllers policy:

        - Audit Logon Events
        - Audit Account Logon Events

    - The Audit system events policy must be set to _"Success"_ for the effective domain controllers
      policy.
    - The Advanced audit policy settings can be configured instead of basic.
    - The Maximum Security event log size must be set to 4GB. The retention method of the Security
      event log must be set to _“Overwrite events as needed”_ or _"Archive the log when full"_.
    - The following Windows Firewall inbound rules must be enabled:

        - Remote Event Log Management (NP-In)
        - Remote Event Log Management (RPC)
        - Remote Event Log Management (RPC-EPMAP)
