# Configure Advanced Audit Policies

You can configure advanced audit policies instead of basic domain policies to collect Logon Activity
changes with more granularity.

Perform the following procedures:

- Configuring security options
- Configuring advanced audit policies

## Configuring security options

Setting up both basic and advanced audit policies may lead to incorrect audit reporting. To force
basic audit policies to be ignored and prevent conflicts, enable the _Audit: Force audit policy
subcategory settings_ policy.

To do it, perform the following steps:

1. Open the **Group Policy Management** console on any domain controller in the target domain:
   navigate to Start > Windows Administrative Tools (Windows Server 2016 and higher) or
   Administrative Tools (Windows 2012) **Group Policy Management.**
2. In the left pane, navigate to **Forest: `<forest_name>` > Domains > `<domain_name>`** **> Domain
   Controllers**. Right-click the effective domain controllers policy (by default, it is the
   **Default Domain Controllers Policy**), and select **Edit** from the pop-up menu.
3. In the Group Policy Management Editor dialog, expand the Computer Configuration node on the left
   and navigate to Policies → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Local Policies → Security
   Options.
4. Locate the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings to override audit policy category
   settings and make sure that policy setting is set to _"Enabled"_.
