# Permissions for SQL Server Auditing

Before you start creating a monitoring plan to audit your SQL Server, plan for the account that will
be used for data collection – it should meet the requirements listed below. Then you will provide
this account in the monitoring plan wizard.

You can use group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) as data collecting accounts.

**On the target SQL Server:**

1. To access SQL Server, Windows authentication will be used, so data collection account should be a
   Windows account specified in the _domain\user_ format (_domain\user$_ for Managed Service
   Account).
   SQL Server logins and authentication method are not supported.
2. The account must be assigned the **System Administrator** server role for this SQL Server. See
   Assigning 'System Administrator' Role section for more information.
3. For auditing SQL Server availability on groups, the account must have the sysadmin server role
   granted on each server added to an availability group.
4. If you plan to collect state-in-time data from SQL Server, in addition to requirements above the
   account will also need:
    - Local **Administrator** rights on the target SQL Server.
    - If SQL Server is included in the Active Directory domain, the account should also be included
      in that domain.

## Assigning 'System Administrator' Role

1. On the computer where audited SQL Server instance is installed, navigate to **Start → All
   Programs → Microsoft SQL Server → SQL Server Management Studio**.
2. Connect to the SQL Server instance.
3. In the left pane, expand the **Security** node. Right-click the **Logins** node and select **New
   Login** from the pop-up menu.

4. Click **Search** next to **Login Name** and specify the user that you want to assign the
   **sysadmin** role to.
5. Specify the **Server roles** tab and assign the **sysadmin** role to the new login.
