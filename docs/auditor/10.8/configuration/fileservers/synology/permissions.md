# Permissions for Synology Auditing

Before you start creating a monitoring plan to audit your Qumulo or Synology file servers, plan for
the account that will be used for data collection â€“ it should meet the requirements listed below.
Then you will provide this account in the monitoring plan wizard (or monitored item settings).

Starting with version 9.96, you can use group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) as data collecting
accounts.

See the [Use Group Managed Service Account (gMSA)](/docs/auditor/10.8/requirements/gmsa.md) topic and the
[Group Managed Service Accounts Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview)
Microsoft article for additional information.

These group Managed Service Accounts should meet the related requirements, as listed below.

**On the target server:**

1. The account requires Read share permission on the audited shared folders.
2. The account requires Read NTFS permission on all objects in the audited folders.
