# Permissions for Dell Isilon/PowerScale Auditing

Before you start creating a monitoring plan to audit your Dell Isilon/PowerScale file storage
system, plan for the account that will be used for data collection. See the Configuring Your Dell
Isilon/PowerScale Cluster for Auditing section for additional information. The following scenarios
are possible:

- Automatic configuration: you can use a special shell script for configuring an audited Dell
  Isilon/PowerScale cluster and granting necessary privileges to the account used to collect audit
  data. See the following topics for additional information:
    - [Configure Dell Isilon/PowerScale Cluster in Normal or Enterprise Mode via Shell Script](normal.md#configure-dell-isilonpowerscale-cluster-in-normal-or-enterprise-mode-via-shell-script)
    - [Configure Dell Isilon/PowerScale Cluster in Compliance Mode Via Shell Script](compliance.md#configure-dell-isilonpowerscale-cluster-in-compliance-mode-via-shell-script)
- Manual configuration: you can grant all the necessary permissions to data collecting account
  manually. See the following topics for additional information:
    - [Configure Dell Isilon/PowerScale Cluster in Normal or Enterprise Mode Manually](normal.md#configure-dell-isilonpowerscale-cluster-in-normal-or-enterprise-mode-manually)
    - [Configure Dell Isilon/PowerScale Cluster in Compliance Mode Manually](compliance.md#configure-dell-isilonpowerscale-cluster-in-compliance-mode-manually)

For manual configuration, ensure the account meets the requirements listed below.

On the target server:

**Step 1 –** The account must be a member of the local Administrators group.

**Step 2 –** The account requires Read permissions on the audited shared folders.

**Step 3 –** The account requires Read permissions on the folder where audit events are logged
(_/ifs/.ifsvar/audit/_)

**Step 4 –** To connect to Dell Isilon/PowerScale storage cluster, an account must be assigned a
custom role (e.g., _netwrix_audit_) that has the following privileges:

|                                    |          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| Platform API (ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_PAPI) | readonly |
| Auth (ISI_PRIV_AUTH)               | readonly |
| Audit (ISI_PRIV_AUDIT)             | readonly |
| Backup (ISI_PRIV_IFS_BACKUP)       | readonly |

**NOTE:** If you plan to connect to a cluster that works in the compliance mode, the account must
meet additional requirements.

## Configuring Your Dell Isilon/PowerScale Cluster for Auditing

A Dell Isilon/PowerScale cluster can operate in one of the following modes:

- Standard or Normal mode
- Smartlock Enterprise mode
- Smartlock Compliance mode

For your convenience, Netwrix provides a special shell script for configuring an audited Dell
Isilon/PowerScale cluster and granting necessary privileges to the account that is used to collect
audit data.

To grant the necessary permissions to Isilon/PowerScale data collecting account manually, you need
to perform all steps for manual audit configuration, otherwise the product will not function
properly.

See the [Normal and Enterprise Modes for Clusters](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/fileservers/dellisilon/normal.md) topic for additional information.
