# File Servers

Netwrix Auditor can monitor for operations with files and folders on the storage systems, collect
state-in-time snapshots and track changes to the object attributes. This section provides detailed
information on these activities.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See
the
[Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html)
knowledge base article for additional information.

The following topics list the operations with files and folders that can be monitored and reported
by Auditor on these supported storage systems.:

- [Dell Data Storage](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/fileservers/delldatastorage/overview.md)
- [Dell Isilon/PowerScale](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/fileservers/dellisilon/overview.md)
- [NetApp Data ONTAP](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/fileservers/netappcmode/overview.md)
- [Nutanix](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/fileservers/nutanix/overview.md)

## State-in-Time Data

State-in-time data collection is supported for files, folders and shares on Windows-based file
servers, Dell and NetApp storage systems, and Nutanix File Servers. Remember to select the
corresponding option in the data source settings within the monitoring plan.

## Sensitive Data

Starting with the version 10, the product is able to report about sensitive data in your IT
infrastructure. Pay attention to the "_Data categories_" column in search and reports (for the
"_File_" object types only). See the
[Sensitive Data Discovery ](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/settings/sensitivedatadiscovery.md) topic for additional
information on how to enable monitoring of sensitive data in Auditor.

## Monitored Object Attributes

The table below lists the object types and attributes that can be monitored by Auditor.

For more information on the attributes marked with (\*) , refer to the following Microsoft article:
[File Attribute Constants](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/gg258117(v=vs.85).aspx).

| Object type | Attributes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

**CAUTION:** File and folder attributes marked with the (\*) are not monitored by default. Please
contact Netwrix Technical Support team to monitor these file and folder attributes.

In addition to general object attributes, Auditor generates the following attributes associated with
the object and reserved for internal use:

- **Session ID** — This attribute is based on the user's logon ID and timestamp of the related logon
  event. Being unique for a user's logon session, it usually helps to distinguish the events and
  changes that occurred within that session.
- **Statement ID** — This attribute appears if an object was moved/renamed due to its root object
  modifications.
