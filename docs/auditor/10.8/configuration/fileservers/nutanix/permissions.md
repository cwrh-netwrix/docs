# Permissions for Nutanix Files Auditing

Before you start creating a monitoring plan to audit Nutanix Files, plan for the accounts that will
be used for data collection. They should meet the requirements listed below.

## Account for Accessing Nutanix File Server

First, you need an account that Netwrix Auditor will use to access Nutanix File Server. This account
requires at least _Read_ permission for the target SMB shares on the Nutanix File Server.

This is the account you will provide in the monitoring plan wizard at the
[Create a New Monitoring Plan](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/create.md) step; it can be modified in
the **General** tab of the monitored item settings.

This account must have a role with sufficient privileges on that server: **File Server Admin**
(recommended) or **Backup Admin** role.

## Account for Accessing REST API

You will also need an account that will be used to connect to Nutanix File Server REST API.

This account should be provided in the **Nutanix File Server REST API** tab of the monitored item
(_Nutanix SMB shares_) settings.

This account must be assigned the **REST API access users** role for Nutanix File Server you want to
audit.

See the section below for the instructions on user role assignment.

**Step 6 –** Click **Save** next to these cells to save the settings.

**Step 7 –** Next, in the **REST API access users** section click **+New user**.
