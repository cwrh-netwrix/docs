# Permissions for AD FS Auditing

Before you start creating a monitoring plan to audit your AD FS federation servers, plan for the
account that will be used for data collection â€“ it should meet the requirements listed below. Then
you will provide this account in the monitoring plan wizard.

**On the target server:**

- If the target AD FS federation server is a domain controller, then the account must belong to the
  **Administrators** or **Domain Admins** group
- Otherwise, if the server is not a domain controller, the account must belong to the **Local
  Administrators** group.
