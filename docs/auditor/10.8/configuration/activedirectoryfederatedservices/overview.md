# AD FS

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and
access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment
and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling
certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data
integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See
the
[Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html)
knowledge base article for additional information.

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server role can be assigned:

- to a domain controller
- to a Windows server joined in the domain

Multiple AD FS federation servers can be included in a **farm**, a group of connected servers with
configuration replicated between them. The first AD FS federation server you set up in the farm
becomes the **primary** server. Other federation servers you add to the farm will become
**secondary** servers.

Make sure you have Windows Remote Management properly configured on your Auditor console computer.
See the [Software Requirements](/docs/auditor/10.8/requirements/software.md) topic for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

- Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to
  automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be
  checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary. See the Configure AD FS farm audit
  settings automatically topic for additional information.
- Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and
  reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or
  configure them manually:

    - AD FS audit settings must be configured on the primary AD FS server, i.e. on the first server
      you have set up in the farm:

        - To configure audit of AD FS 4.0 on Windows Server 2016 or AD FS 5.0 on Windows Server
          2019, use the following PowerShell cmdlets:

            ```
            Set-AdfsProperties -LogLevel Errors,FailureAudits,Verbose,SuccessAudits,Warnings
            Set-AdfsProperties –AuditLevel Verbose
            ```

        - To configure audit of AD FS 3.0 on Windows Server 2012 R2, use the following PowerShell
          cmdlet

            ```
            Set-AdfsProperties -LogLevel Errors,FailureAudits,Verbose,SuccessAudits,Warnings
            ```

    - Windows Audit policy must be configured on each server in the farm. For all Windows server
      versions Run the _auditpol_ utility with the following parameters:

        - `auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:"Application Generated" /failure:enable /success:enable`

    - Adjust log size and retention settings for **Security** log and for **AD FS Admin** log (under
      **Applications and Service logs**). See
      [Adjusting Event Log Size and Retention Settings](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/eventlog.md) for details.
    - If AD FS Admin logging is disabled, you should enable it.
    - See the Configure AD FS farm manually topic for additional information.

## **Configure AD FS farm audit settings automatically**

Audit settings can be applied automatically if your monitoring plan has the primary AD FS federation
server included as an item. If it has only secondary AD FS federation servers included, you will
need to configure audit settings manually, as described later in this section.

**Step 1 –** Select the AD FS data source in this monitoring plan (top row under the header), click
**Edit data source** to open its settings.

![mp_adfs_listing_thumb_0_0](/images/auditor/10.7/configuration/activedirectoryfederatedservices/mp_adfs_listing_thumb_0_0.webp)

**Step 2 –** In the **Configure audit settings** section, select **Adjust audit settings
automatically** check box.

![mp_data_source_ad_fs_thumb_0_0](/images/auditor/10.7/configuration/activedirectoryfederatedservices/mp_data_source_ad_fs_thumb_0_0.webp)

**Step 3 –** Save the settings.

Auditor  will automatically configure audit settings on all servers in the AD FS farm and adjust the
necessary log settings on these servers.

## Configure AD FS farm manually

Follow the steps to enable AD FS audit settings and set up Windows audit policy.

**Step 1 –** AD FS audit settings must be configured on the primary AD FS server, i.e. on the first
server you have set up in the farm:

- To configure audit of AD FS 3.0 on Windows Server 2012 R2, use the following PowerShell cmdlet:

Set-AdfsProperties -LogLevel Errors,FailureAudits,Verbose,SuccessAudits,Warnings

- To configure audit of AD FS 4.0 on Windows Server 2016 or AD FS 5.0 on Windows Server 2019, use
  the following PowerShell cmdlets:

Set-AdfsProperties -LogLevel Errors,FailureAudits,Verbose,SuccessAudits,Warnings

Set-AdfsProperties –AuditLevel Verbose

**Step 2 –** Windows Audit policy must be configured on each server in the farm. For all Windows
server versions

- Run the _auditpol_ utility with the following parameters:

```auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:"Application Generated" /failure:enable /success:enable

```

**Step 3 –** Adjust log size and retention settings for **Security** log and for **AD FS Admin** log
(under **Applications and Service logs**). See the
[Adjusting Event Log Size and Retention Settings](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/eventlog.md) topic for additional
information.

If AD FS Admin logging is disabled, you should enable it.

_Remember,_ do the following:

- Configure Data Collecting Account as described in the
  [Permissions for AD FS Auditing](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/activedirectoryfederatedservices/permissions.md) topic.
- Configure ports as described in the [AD FS Ports](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/activedirectoryfederatedservices/ports.md) topic.

## AD FS Servers Data Collection

For Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers, Netwrix Auditor can collect audit data on
the events and configuration objects listed below.

| Event type             | Action           | Details                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| AD FS logon (intranet) | Failed Logon     | Cause (for failed attempts)                      |
| AD FS logon (extranet) | Successful Logon | Authentication methods (for Successful attempts) |

Configuration information can be collected for the following objects:

- AD FS servers included in the farm
- Application Groups settings
- Authentication Method names
- Relying Party Trusts settings
- Scope Descriptions
