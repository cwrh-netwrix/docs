# Access Exchange Online Using Modern Authentication

Support for modern authentication will allow you to audit the organizations where MFA is enabled for
all users, including service accounts.

This option is recommended for organizations that use modern authentication as the identity
management approach, having multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled for their user accounts. In
this scenario, Netwrix Auditor will access the cloud-based infrastructure via Microsoft Graph and
other modern APIs, being authenticated through a pre-configured Microsoft Entra ID application with
appropriate access permissions.

If you plan to implement this scenario, you should register an Microsoft Entra ID app manually and
provide its settings to Netwrix Auditor when configuring a monitored item.

### Create and Register a New App in Microsoft Entra ID

You will need to create a dedicated app for each cloud-based data source you plan to audit:

- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- Exchange Online
- SharePoint Online
- MS Teams

If you plan to audit all of them, you need to create 4 apps.

Follow the steps to register a new Microsoft Entra ID application.

**Step 1 –** Sign into the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** with your _Global Administrator_,
_Application Administrator_ or _Cloud Application Administrator_ account and go to the **Microsoft
Entra ID admin center**.

**Step 2 –** Under the App registrations section, select **New registration**.

**Step 3 –** In the Name field, enter the application name.

**Step 4 –** In the Supported account types select who can use this application – use the **Accounts
in this organizational directory only** option.

**Step 5 –** Click the **Register** button. Application **Redirect URI** is optional, you can leave
it blank.

**Step 6 –** Your Application (client) ID is now available in the Overview section. Copy it to a
safe location.

See the following Microsoft article for additional information on how to create an application and
service principal using Microsoft Entra ID Admin portal:
[Create an Microsoft Entra ID application and service principal that can access resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

### Grant Required Permissions

You need to grant your new application the required API permissions. Microsoft Entra ID applications
can be assigned _Delegated_ or _Application_ permissions:

- _Delegated_ permissions require a signed-in user present who consents to the permissions every
  time an API call is sent.
- _Application_ permissions are consented by an administrator once granted.

For the newly created app, you should use the _Application_ permissions.

To grant required permissions, assign granular _Application_ permissions required for Netwrix
Auditor to collect data from the application. To do so, perform the following steps:

**Step 1 –** Go to the **App registrations** and open the app you created to assign Auditor
permissions.

**Step 2 –** Go to **Manage > API permissions** and click **Add a permission** button.

**Step 3 –** Assign the required permissions.

Permission assignment will depend on the data you plan to collect:

- Activity data only
- Both activity and state-in-time data

**NOTE:** You can also assign application permissions by editing Microsoft Entra app manifest. See
the Access Exchange Online Using Modern Authentication topic for additional information on how to
assign the required permissions. Information about manifest is also described in the following
Microsoft
article: [ Microsoft Entra app manifest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest).
