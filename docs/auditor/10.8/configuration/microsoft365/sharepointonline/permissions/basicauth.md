# Using Basic Authentication with SharePoint Online

With basic authentication, your SharePoint Online will be accessed on behalf of a user. You will
need to provide Office 365 user name and password in the monitored item properties. To access the
Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)/Office 365 organization and perform initial data collection,
the user account will need an administrative role in the cloud-based infrastructure.

The user account should be a _Cloud-only_ account.

Further permission assignment will depend on the data you plan to collect:

- To collect both activity and state-in-time data, the administrative role will be still needed. See
  the table below for details.
- To collect activity data only, the privileged role can be revoked from the specified account after
  the initial data collection.

## Assigning a Privileged Role for SharePoint and Office 365

When configuring a monitored item for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) or Office 365 auditing
with basic authentication, specify a data collecting account that has sufficient privileges in
Microsoft Entra ID. This account should be able to create a dedicated application in your Microsoft
Entra ID domain. Depending on your requirements and company policies, you can select one of the
following approaches:

- Assign a privileged role (for example, _Application Administrator_ & _Privileged Role
  Administrator_) to the account, then revoke it after the application creation and initial data
  collection, and assign a less-privileged role to this account (for example, _Security Reader_).
- Use the account with a privileged role on a regular basis. Any additional role assignments will
  not be necessary in this case. If you select this method, contact your security administrator to
  avoid violations of security policies in your organization.

**NOTE:** If you previously used a non-privileged account for Microsoft Entra ID data collection in
your Netwrix Auditor, consider that after the upgrade you will have to perform the role assignment
procedure again, selecting one of these approaches. Until then, data collection will not be
performed.

Follow the steps to assign a privileged role to the account.

**Step 1 –** Sign in to Microsoft Entra ID portal using your Microsoft account.

**Step 2 –** Select Microsoft Entra ID on the left.

**Step 3 –** Select the account that you want to use as data collecting account, or create a new
user.

**Step 4 –** Make sure you have disabled multi-factor authentication for this account.

**Step 5 –** Expand Directory role and select the role you need (for example, Global admin or any
other privileged role).

_Remember,_ In Microsoft Graph API, Microsoft Entra ID Graph API, and Microsoft Entra ID PowerShell,
the Global admin role is identified as Company Administrator.

**Step 6 –** Click OK.

**Step 7 –** In Auditor, create a monitoring plan for auditing Microsoft Entra ID and specify this
account with this privileged role on the Specify the account for collecting data step.

**Step 8 –** Wait until initial data collection completes.

**Step 9 –** Open Microsoft Entra ID portal and remove the privileged role from the account.

**Step 10 –** Assign a less-privileged role to this account.

A less privileged role has now been assigned to the account.
