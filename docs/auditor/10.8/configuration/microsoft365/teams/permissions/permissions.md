# Permissions for Teams Auditing

Auditor allows you to audit Office 365 organizations that have established modern authentication as
their identity management approach, including support for
[multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks).
To learn more about modern authentication, refer to the following Microsoft article:
[What is modern authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/hybrid-modern-auth-overview#what-is-modern-authentication).

In this scenario, Netwrix Auditor will access the cloud-based infrastructure via Microsoft Graph and
other modern APIs, being authenticated through a pre-configured Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure
AD) application with appropriate access permissions. So, you should register an Microsoft Entra ID
app and provide its settings to Auditor  when configuring a monitored item.

**NOTE:** In some scenarios multi-factor authentication cannot be enabled for Auditor  service
account. If so, you will need to configure an account with basic authentication to access Microsoft
Entra ID/Office 365 tenant.

## For Microsoft Teams

Before you start creating a monitoring plan to audit your Active Directory, plan for the account
that will be used for data collection – it should meet the requirements listed in this topic. Then
you will provide this account in the monitoring plan wizard (or in the monitored item settings).

Refer to the following topics to access Microsoft teams:
