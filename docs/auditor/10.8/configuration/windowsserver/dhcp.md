2. Navigate to Event Viewer tree → Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows and expand
   the DHCP-Server node.
3. Right-click the Operational log and select Properties.

4. Make sure the **Enable logging** option is selected.
5. Set **Maximum log size** to **4 GB**.
6. Set the retention method to **Overwrite events as needed (oldest events first)**. Click **OK** to
   save the settings and close the dialog.
