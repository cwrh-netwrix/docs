# Windows Server Ports

Review a full list of protocols and ports required for Netwrix Auditor for Windows Server.

- Allow outbound connections from the dynamic (1024 - 65535) local port on the computer where
  Netwrix Auditor Server resides.
- Allow outbound connections to remote ports on the source and inbound connections to local ports on
  the target.

Tip for reading the table: For example, on the computer where Netwrix Auditor Server resides
(source), allow outbound connections to remote 139 TCP port. On monitored computers (target), allow
inbound connections to local 139 TCP port.

## Configure Windows Firewall Inbound Connection Rules

You can also configure Windows Firewall settings through Group Policy settings. To do this, edit the
GPO affecting your firewall settings. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative
Templates > Network >Network Connections > Windows Firewall, select Domain Profile or Standard
Profile. Then, enable the Allow inbound remote administration exception.

**Step 1 –** On each audited server, navigate to **Start** > **Control Panel** and select **Windows
Firewall**.

**Step 2 –** In the Help Protect your computer with Windows Firewall page, click **Advanced
settings** on the left.

**Step 3 –** In the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security dialog, select **Inbound Rules** on the
left.

**Step 4 –** Enable the following inbound connection rules:

- Remote Event Log Management (NP-In)
- Remote Event Log Management (RPC)
- Remote Event Log Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Windows Management Instrumentation (ASync-In)
- Windows Management Instrumentation (DCOM-In)
- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI-In)
- Network Discovery (NB-Name-In)
- File and Printer Sharing (NB-Name-In)
- File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)
- File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv6-In)
- Remote Service Management (NP-In)
- Remote Service Management (RPC)
- Performance Logs and Alerts (DCOM-In)
- Performance Logs and Alerts (Tcp-In)

If you plan to audit Windows Server 2019 or Windows 10 Update 1803 without network compression
service, make sure the following inbound connection rules are enabled:

- Remote Scheduled Tasks Management (RPC)
- Remote Scheduled Tasks Management (RPC-EMAP)
