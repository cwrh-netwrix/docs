# Owners & Access Reviews

This topic and its subtopics are written for users who have been assigned resource ownership.

When your organization performs an access review on a resource for which you are the assigned owner,
it means you, the business user or data custodian, need to attest to the access and privileges users
have to your resource.

**NOTE:** For the Netwrix Auditor Access Reviews application, a “resource” refers to the file system
shared folders, SharePoint Online site collections, and Active Directory (AD) groups.

Your organization's Ownership Administrator and/or Review Administrator will let you know what URL
to use for logging in as well as what credentials to use. The URL will require you to be connected
to your organization's network. Upon login, you will be directed to the My Reviews page where you
can view pending and historical reviews for your resources.

You may receive email notifications requesting ownership confirmation from your organization's
Ownership Administrators. You will receive email notifications when you have a pending access review
to perform.
