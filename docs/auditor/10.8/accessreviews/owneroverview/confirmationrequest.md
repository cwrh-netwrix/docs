# Ownership Confirmation Request Email

The Ownership Administrator may request ownership confirmation for a resource being managed through
the Access Reviews application. As an assigned owner, you will receive the following email.

The Ownership Confirmation Request email provides buttons for confirming (Yes) or declining (No)
ownership of the listed resource. You will be asked to authenticate for your response to be
processed. The application will launch in your default browser. Enter your domain credentials to
complete the process. One of two messages will appear according to if you confirmed or declined.

## Confirmed Ownership Message

If you have accepted ownership for the assigned resource, the browser will display the following
message after authentication:

e-mail."

## Declined Ownership Message

If you have declined ownership for the assigned resource, the browser will display the following
message after authentication:
