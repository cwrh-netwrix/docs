# Approval Process

After all owners assigned to a specific review have submitted their review, its status on the Manage
Reviews page of the Entitlement Reviews interface changes to Responses awaiting review.

In the approval process, the Review Administrator looks at the owner-recommended changes and chooses
to approve, deny, or defer the changes.

See the Process Owner Responses topic for instructions on how to perform a granular review of
owner-recommended changes. See the Batch Processing topic for instructions on how to approve,
decline, or defer all owner-recommended changes for a review.
