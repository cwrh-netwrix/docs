# Add Owner Window

The Add Owner window opens from either the [Add New Resource Wizard](/docs/auditor/10.8/accessreviews/resourceowners/interface/add.md) of the
[Update Resource Wizard](/docs/auditor/10.8/accessreviews/resourceowners/interface/update.md). This window is used to search for a user account by
browsing Active Directory.

Enter a name in the search field to find and select users from Active Directory, which populates in
a drop-down menu as you type. If multiple domains are known to the application, ensure the correct
domain is selected from the drop-down menu. Click **OK** and the Add Owner window closes. The
selected user appears in the Owner list.
