# Secure Console Access

Enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure, remote connections to the application web server. In
order to enable SSL, you need to create a certificate and then bind it to the secure port.

**NOTE:** Organizations typically have one or more system administrators responsible for Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) and certificates. To continue with this configuration, it will first be
necessary to confer with the PKI administrator to determine which certificate method will conform to
the organization’s security policies.

Follow the steps to enable SSL.

**Step 1 –** Create an SSL Binding.

**Step 2 –** Modify the AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config File.

The Access Reviews application is now configured to use SSL for secure, remote connections.

## Create an SSL Binding

You run a PowerShell command to create an SSL binding. The binding command has several environmental
variables:

- The `$certHash` value is the `Thumbprint` value.
- The `$ip` value of the IP addresses. In the example script below, the value [0.0.0.0] is set for
  all IP addresses.
- The `$port` value must be accurate for your environment. The HTTP default port is 81. The HTTPS
  default is 481. However, it can be customized during installation.
- The `$guid` value is required for specifying a valid GUID value to identify the owning application
  for a binding purpose. It obtained from any valid GUID.

If you need to find the `$certHash` value of a certificate that was already created, run the
PowerShell `dir` command below on the certificate's drive. This will output the Thumbprint (Hash)
value and the certificate name:

```powershell
dir cert:\localmachine\my
```

Replace the environmental variables in the example script below. Then Run the PowerShell command to
create an SSL binding:

```powershell
$guid = "1be32670-7644-4dce-9a5d-01643022074e"
$certHash = "03CFD5D51A0DAA2F3DCDA9407486B220449D0E92"
$ip = "0.0.0.0"
$port = "481"
"http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}" | netsh
```

The next step is to modify the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file.

## Modify the AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config File

Follow the steps to modify the Modify the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file for
HTTPS.

**Step 1 –** Open the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file in a text editor, e.g.
Notepad. It is located in the installation directory:

...\Netwrix\Access Reviews

![AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config file showing the BindingUrl key](/images/auditor/10.7/access/reviews/installation/securebindingurlparameter.webp)

**Step 2 –** Change the `BindingUrl` key value to `"https://+:481"` (ensure the port number matches
the port number used in the PowerShell command run to create the SSL Binding.

**Step 3 –** Save and close the file.

**Step 4 –** Restart the Netwrix Auditor Access Reviews service in Services Manager
`(services.msc`).

The URL for the Access Reviews Console is now accessible
`https://[Fully Qualified Domain Name for the Machine]:481` (if port 481 was used when creating the
binding). For example, https://NEWYORKSRV10.NWXTech.com:481.
