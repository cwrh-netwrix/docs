# Change Log Level

The `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file is located in the `Logs` folder of the Access
Reviews installation directory:

...\Netwrix\Access Reviews

Follow the steps to modify the log level.

**Step 1 –** Open the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file in a text editor, e.g.
Notepad.

![AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config file in Notepad](/images/auditor/10.7/access/reviews/admin/troubleshooting/logvalue.webp)

**Step 2 –** The level value is set in the `LogLevel` parameter, where "2" is the default level. As
the logging level increases from 0 to 3, the types of information and level of detail included
within the log file also increase. Change to the desired log level:

<add key="LogLevel" value="2" />

- Error level is when `value="0"`
- Warning level is when `value="1"`
- Info level is when `value="2"`
- Debug level is when `value="3"`

    - Debug logging can be enabled from the Diagnostics page of the Configuration interface

**Step 3 –** Save and close the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file.

Once troubleshooting has finished, it is recommended to return the log level to the default level,
Info = 2, to prevent the log file from growing too large.
