### Authentication

Authentication is required for all endpoints. The following authentication methods are supported:

- NTLM—recommended

    If NTLM authentication is disabled through a group policy, you will not be able to address
    Netwrix Auditor Server by its IP address.

- Negotiate
- Digest
- Basic

### Account Permissions

Netwrix Auditor restricts control to its configuration and data collected by the product. Role-based
access system ensures that only relevant employees and services can access the exact amount of data
they need. To be able to retrieve activity records or supply data to the Audit Database, an account
must be assigned a role in the product.
