# Customize Branding

Netwrix Auditor allows customizing look and feel of your reports, search subscriptions and exported
search results—you can skip Netwrix logo, add your company logo and title. However, users are not
empowered to customize layout or color scheme.

Review the following for additional information:

- Customize Branding in AuditIntelligence Outputs
- Customize Branding in Reports

## Customize Branding in AuditIntelligence Outputs

You can customize branding for the following AuditIntelligence outputs:

- Search results delivered as pdf file in the search subscription email;
- Search results exported to pdf file;
- Risk Assessment dashboard exported to pdf file;
- Risk Assessment dashboard delivered in the subscription email;
- Overview dashboard exported to pdf file;
- Overview dashboard delivered in the subscription email.

Please note the following rebranding limitations and requirements to the logo file:

1. Make sure you have full Netwrix Auditor installation: Netwrix Auditor Server and Client to enable
   rebranding.
2. Since Netwrix applies company's logo as is, keep in mind reasonable limitations of your logo
   dimensions. You can find examples of appropriate logo files in the rebranding archive (file
   LLogo.webp). Re-size your logo and verify that subscriptions emails and pdf files look fine after
   rebranding.
3. Only PNG images can be used as logo files.
4. Endure that image file is located in the default directory or custom folder. Consider the
   following:

    - For subscription emails, just put the logo file to _%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Netwrix
      Auditor\Branding_ and run the script to update email look and feel.
    - For exported pdf files, make sure that the logo file is located in the default directory for
      each user that is going to work with exported search results, Risk Assessment and Overview
      dashboards. Otherwise, specify custom path to logo file. Default path to logo for exported
      files is _%LOCALAPPDATA%\Netwrix Auditor\Audit Intelligence\Resources_.

Follow the steps t o customize branding

**Step 1 –** On the computer where the Netwrix Auditor Server is installed, navigate to

**Step 4 –** Generate any test subscription email or export a dashboard to pdf file to verify that
rebranding applied.

To restore original look and feel, run the script and replace"_True_" with "_False_" in the
"_enabled_" section.
