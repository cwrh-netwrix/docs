# IT Risk Assessment Overview

To help you identify configuration gaps in your environment and understand their impact on overall
security, Netwrix Auditor offers a dashboard with a number of metrics and drill-down reports on IT
risk assessment. They pinpoint the weak points in your IT infrastructure such as overly broad
assignment of access rights, loose password policies, and stale accounts. This information will help
you to take corrective measures in the required area, ensuring the IT risks stay in the safe zone.

Risk assessment dashboard can be accessed by clicking the Risk assessment tile in the main window of
Netwrix Auditor. For details about using the dashboard, see
[IT Risk Assessment Dashboard](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/riskassessment/dashboard.md).

For details about metrics calculation, see [How Risk Levels Are Estimated ](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/riskassessment/levels.md).

## Providing Data for Risk Assessment

To provide data for metrics and reports that belong to different categories, you will need to
configure monitoring plans that will process related data sources. These monitoring plans should
have at least one item added. See the following table for the certain reports:

| Category                                                                | Report name                                   | Collect data from   |

| Administrative groups                                                   | AD domain                                     |                     |

**NOTE:** Risks marked with (\*) require both pre-configured NDC SQL database connection and NDC API
connection. To check configuration status, go to Settings > Sensitive Data Discovery. See
[Sensitive Data Discovery ](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/settings/sensitivedatadiscovery.md)for more information.

**NOTE:** Right after setting up the integration the drill down reports might be empty, while the
risk indicator is already completed. Please wait until Auditor gets all the information from Netwrix
Data Classification it needs.

## Required Monitoring Plan Settings

To provide data needed for risk assessment, the related monitoring plan must be set up to store data
to the audit database.

Also, consider that all risk metrics and related reports require state-in-time data to be collected.
You can select the relevant option when creating a new monitoring plan, as described in the
[Create a New Monitoring Plan](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/create.md) section. For the exising plan, refer to
the procedure below.

To verify the necessary settings of the existing plan

1. Select the monitoring plan you need and click the **Edit** button.
2. In the right pane of the dialog displayed, select Edit settings from the Monitoring plan section.
3. Go to the Audit Database section and make sure that Disable security intelligence ... checkbox is
   cleared. This will instruct Netwrix Auditor to store data to both Long-Term Archive and audit
   database:
   ![edit_mp_store_data_to_db_thumb_0_0](/images/auditor/10.7/admin/riskassessment/edit_mp_store_data_to_db_thumb_0_0.webp)
4. Save the settings and return to the window with the monitoring plan details. Make sure you have
   at least one monitored item in the plan. If necessary, add an item.
5. Select the data source you need (for example, Active Directory) and click Edit data source from
   the Data source section on the right.
   ![edit_mp_open_ds_settings_thumb_0_0](/images/auditor/10.7/admin/riskassessment/edit_mp_open_ds_settings_thumb_0_0.webp)
6. Make sure that:
    1. Monitor this data source and collect activity data is switched ON.
    2. Collect data for state-in-time reports is switched ON.
7. Save the settings and close the dialog.
