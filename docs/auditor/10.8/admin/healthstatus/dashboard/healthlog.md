## Netwrix Auditor System Health Log

When an error occurs, a system administrator or support engineer must determine what caused this
error and prevent it from recurring. For your convenience, Auditor records important events in the
proprietary Netwrix Auditor **System Health** event log.

You can review events directly in the product:

- When issues encountered during data collection, click Details... in the Status column and select
  View Health Log.

    OR

- In the main screen, in the Configuration section click the Health status tile, then in the Health
  log dashboard widget click Open health log.

You can also inspect the log in the Event Viewer.

There are three types of events that can be logged:

| Event Type  | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
