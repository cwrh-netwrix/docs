# Subscriptions

Subscriptions enable you to schedule email delivery of a variety of reports or set of specific
search criteria. Subscriptions are helpful if you are a rare guest of Netwrix Auditor and you only
need to get statistics based on individual criteria. For example, an IT manager can easily provide
auditors with weekly reports to prove compliance with regulations.

You can configure subscriptions to reports (including dashboards) risk assessment overview and
interactive search.

You can add any elements (a dashboard, report, alert, risk, etc.) to the Auditor Home screen to
access them instantly. See the [Navigation](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/navigation/overview.md) and
[Customize Home Screen](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/navigation/customizehome.md) topics for additional information.
