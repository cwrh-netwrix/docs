# Reports

Netwrix Auditor provides a variety of reports for each data source. This helps you keep track of all
changes in your IT infrastructure and validate compliance with various standards and regulations
(FISMA, HIPAA, PCI, SOX, etc.). You can also create your custom reports based on the Interactive
Search technology.

To review intelligence data, you must be assigned the Global administrator or Global reviewer role
in the product. The users assigned the Reviewer role on a certain plan or folder have a limited
access to data—only within a delegated scope. See the
[Role-Based Access and Delegation](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/delegation.md) topic for additional
informatuion.
