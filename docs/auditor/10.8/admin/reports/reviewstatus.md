# Interactive Reports for Change Management Workflow

Change management is one of the critical processes for many companies referring to such areas as
requesting, planning, implementing, and evaluating changes to various systems. For your change
management workflow, Netwrix Auditor offers several reports with interactive capabilities – not only
they list changes in your infrastructure but also allow you to track, analyze, assign appropriate
status and comment on these changes.

This capability can supplement your organization's workflow of monitoring and resolving potential
issues through the following automated course of action:

1. The reported changes to the monitored environment are assigned the New status by default.
2. If a change seems unauthorized, or requires further analysis, you can click the Click to update
   status link next to the change detailed data:
   ![reviewstatus_thumb_0_0](/images/auditor/10.7/admin/reports/reviewstatus_thumb_0_0.webp)3.
   In the **Review status** dialog for selected change, set its status to In Review and provide a
   reason.
3. Once the change has been approved of, or rolled back, you can set its status to Resolved.

This capability is supported for the following reports:
