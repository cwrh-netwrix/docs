# Predefined Reports

Netwrix Auditor is shipped with 250+ ready-to-use reports designed by Netwrix industry experts. To
find a report that is right for you, check out the predefined report types available in the product.

- Enterprise Overview—A dashboard with a set of widgets that provide quick access to important
  statistics across the audited IT infrastructure. They allow you to see the activity trends by
  date, user, data source, server or audited IT system, and drill through to detailed reports for
  further analysis. The Enterprise Overview dashboard aggregates the information on changes from all
  data sources and provides a centralized overview. System-specific dashboards reflect all changes
  across all monitoring plans where audit of this target system is enabled. See the
  [Enterprise Overview Dashboard](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/reports/types/enterprise.md) topic for additional information.
- Organization level reports—High-level reports that aggregate data from all data sources and
  monitoring plans. They list all activity that occurred across the audited IT infrastructure.
  Enterprise Overview provides bird's eye view of changes and activity from all data sources and
  provides a centralized overview. See the [ Organization Level Reports](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/reports/types/organizationlevel.md) topic
  for additional information.
- Overview diagrams—System-specific diagram reports that aggregate audit data for an auditing
  system. They provide a high-level overview of changes within a selected time period. Overviews
  consist of four charts, showing the activity trends by date, user, object type or server, and
  drill through to detailed reports for further analysis.
- Change and activity reports—System-specific reports that aggregate audit data for a specific data
  source within specified monitoring plans. These reports show detailed data on changes and activity
  and provide grouping, sorting and filtering capabilities. Each report has a different set of
  filters allowing you to manage collected data in the most convenient way. See the
  [Change and Activity Reports](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/reports/types/activity.md) topic for additional information.
- State-in-time reports—System-specific reports that aggregate data for a specific data source
  within a specified individual monitoring plan and allow reviewing the point-in-time state of the
  data source. These reports are based on daily snapshots and help you paint a picture of your
  system configuration at a specific moment in time. Currently, the Windows Server State-in-Time
  report set provides baselining functionality that help identify aberrant servers. See the
  [State–In–Time Reports](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/reports/types/stateintime/overview.md) topic for additional information.
- Changes with video reports—Windows server-based reports that provide video recordings of user
  activity on audited computers. See the [Reports with Video](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/reports/video.md) topic for additional
  information.
- Changes with review status reports—Both system-specific and overview reports that can be used in
  the basic change management process. These reports allow setting a review status for each change
  and providing comments. See the
  [Interactive Reports for Change Management Workflow](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/reports/reviewstatus.md) topic for additional
  information.
