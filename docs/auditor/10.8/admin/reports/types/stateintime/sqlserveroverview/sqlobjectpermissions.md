# Object Permissions in SQL Server

This report shows a detailed list of the effective permissions that accounts have on the selected
object. Use this report to review who has access to your SQL Server objects.

Supported object types and attributes are listed in the
[SQL Server](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/sqlserver/overview.md) section.

## Reported data

The report has a summary section with general information on the selected SQL Server object, and the
details section presented in the table format.

The summary section shows:

- **Object path** — monitored object path as formatted by Netwrix Auditor in the activity records
  (see '_What_' field in the reports, search results and activity summaries). For example, if
  reporting on the database hosted on selected SQL Server, the path will be as follows:
  _Databases\database_name_.
- **Object type** — monitored object type; for the full list of supported object types, refer to
  [SQL Server](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/sqlserver/overview.md) topic.
- **Total account count** — total number of accounts that have access to this object.

The detailed information under summary includes:

- **User account** —name or SID of the account that has permissions on the selected object.
- **Account type** —possible values:
    - Windows Account
    - Login SQL Authentication
    - DB SQL User with password
- **Means granted** —how access permissions were granted to this account, e.g., _Direct permissions_
  or _Server role permissions_.
- **Job title** —reported for Active Directory users as set in their corresponding attribute. If not
  set, _`<not set>`_ is reported.
- **Effective grant** —the effective set of permissions granted to this account on the selected
  object.

Covering rules do not need to be applied, since **Effective grant** permissions are reported
automatically using these rules.

## Filters

This report has the following filters:

- **Monitoring plan** — name of the monitoring plan set to collect data from the SQL Server you
  need.
- **Time zone** — time zone where Netwrix Auditor server is located, for example, UTC-08:00. This
  value is filled in automatically.
- **Snapshot date** —select the date of state-in-time snapshot you want to report on. By default,
  the report includes data obtained during the latest data collection session (_Current Session_).
  To report on other snapshots, make sure they are available through import. For details, see
  **Manage historical snapshots** option description in the
  [SQL Server](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/sqlserver/overview.md) topic.
- **Item**—name of the SQL Server instance monitored with selected monitoring plan.
- **Object path** —path to the monitored object, as formatted by Netwrix Auditor in the activity
  records (see '_What_' field in the reports, search results and activity summaries). Wildcard (\*)
  is supported. For example, to report on the database hosted on selected SQL Server, specify the
  path as follows: _Databases\database_name_.
- **Permissions** —access permissions which assignment you want to be reported for the selected
  object.
- **Means granted** —how access permissions were granted to this account. You can select _Directly_,
  _Inherited_, or both (default setting).
- **User account**—name or SID of the account that has permissions on the selected object. Default
  is _%_ (all accounts).
- **Account type** —possible values: _Windows Account_, _Login SQL Authentication_, _DB SQL User
  with password_.
- **Job title (Active Directory)** —reported for Active Directory users as set in their
  corresponding attribute. Default is _%_ (any title).

## Considerations and limitations

- Reporting for case-sensitive SQL Servers and databases is not supported.
- The report will not show the RESTORE capability for the database owner.

- When calculating effective rights and permissions, the following will not be considered:
    - Ownership chaining
    - Cross DB ownership chaining
    - Trustworthy database
    - SQL Server agent fixed database roles
- Some permissions may not be reported correctly due to the known issues. See Release Notes for
  details.

## Usage example

Database administrators need to discover who currently has access permissions to **FinReports**
database stored on the **SQLSrv01\SQLServer2016** instance. This instance is included in the
monitoring plan named _SQL Servers Monitoring_.

To examine the relevant data, they need to generate **Object Permissions in SQL Server** report with
the filters set as follows:

- **Monitoring plan:** _SQL Servers Monitoring_
- **Snapshot date:** _Current Session_
- **Item:** _SQLSrv01\SQLServer2016_
- **Object path:** _Databases\FinReports_

All other filter values can be left default.
