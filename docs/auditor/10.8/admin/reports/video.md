# Reports with Video

Netwrix Auditor can be configured to capture video of user activity on the monitored computers that
helps analyze and control changes made there. When you click a link, a video player opens and
playback of the recorded user activity starts, showing launched applications, actions, etc.

To view reports with video, navigate to Reports → User Activity.

In the report filters, select a monitoring plan you want to generate a report for. To review data
sources and items included in each plan, navigate to the Monitoring Plans section.

Each report has a set of filters which help organize audit data in the most convenient way. See the
[View Reports](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/reports/view.md) topic for additional information. You can also create a subscription to any
report you want to receive on a regular basis. See the [Subscriptions](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/subscriptions/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

Follow the steps to play a video:
