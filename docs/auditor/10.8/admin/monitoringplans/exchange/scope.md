# Exchange Monitoring Scope

You can fine-tune Auditor by specifying data that you want to exclude from the Exchange monitoring
scope. In addition, you can exclude data from non-owner access auditing.

- Exchange Monitoring Scope
- To exclude users or mailboxes from the Mailbox Access monitoring scope

Follow the steps to exclude data from the Exchange monitoring scope:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the _%Netwrix Auditor installation folder%\Active Directory Auditing_
folder.

**Step 2 –** Edit the \*.txt files, based on the following guidelines:

- Each entry must be a separate line.
- A wildcard (\*) is supported. You can use \* for cmdlets and their parameters.
- Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.

To exclude users or mailboxes from the Mailbox Access monitoring scope

Auditor  allows specifying users and mailboxes that you do not want to monitor for non-owner mailbox
access events. To do this, edit the mailboxestoexclude.txt, userstoexclude.txt, and
agentomitusers.txt files.

Follow the steps to exclude data from Exchange Online monitoring scope

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the _%Netwrix Auditor installation folder%\Non-owner Mailbox Access
Reporter for Exchange_ folder.

**Step 2 –** Edit mailboxestoexclude.txt, userstoexclude.txt, or agentomitusers.txt files, based on
the following guidelines:

- Each entry must be a separate line.
- A wildcard (\*) is supported. You can use \* for cmdlets and their parameters.
- Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.

You can also limit your reports by specific mailboxes. Edit the mailboxestoinclude.txt file to
specify mailboxes.
