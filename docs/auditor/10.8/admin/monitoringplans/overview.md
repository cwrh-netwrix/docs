# Monitoring Plans

**NOTE:** Prior to configuring your monitoring plan, please read and complete the instructions in
the following topics:

- [Protocols and Ports Required](/docs/auditor/10.8/requirements/ports.md) – To ensure successful data collection
  and activity monitoring configure necessary protocols and ports for inbound and outbound
  connections
- [Data Collecting Account](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/dataaccounts.md) – Configure data collecting accounts as required to
  audit your IT systems

- [Supported Data Sources](/docs/auditor/10.8/requirements/supporteddatasources/supporteddatasources.md) – Configure data source as
  required to be monitored

To start auditing your environment and analyzing user behavior with Netwrix Auditor, create a
monitoring plan.

A monitoring plan defines data collection, notification, and storage settings.

To start collecting data, and add items to its scope.

Follow the steps to collect data from your environment.

**Step 1 –** Create a monitoring plan with the wizard. Select the data source when you start the
monitoring plan wizard, and its initial settings are configured at the wizard steps. See the
[Create a New Monitoring Plan](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/create.md) topic for additional information.

**Step 2 –** Fine-tune data source settings, if necessary: use the data source properties to modify
data collection settings, customize the monitoring scope, and more.

**Step 3 –** Add items to be monitored. An item is a specific object you want to audit, e.g., a
VMware server or a SharePoint farm. As soon as the item is added, to the monitoring plan, Auditor
starts collecting data from it. See the
[Add Items for Monitoring](datasources.md#add-items-for-monitoring) topic for additional
information.

**Step 4 –** To view and modify your plans, in the main Auditor window click the Monitoring Plans
tile, then expand the All Monitoring Plans tree.

You can delegate control over a monitoring plan to another administrator, or grant read access—Reviewer role—to the data collected by this plan. To simplify delegation, you can further organize the monitoring plans into folders.

## Using historical data

For many data sources, you can instruct Netwrix Auditor to collect state-in-time data along with
event data. For that, Netwrix Auditor uses state-in-time snapshots of the relevant system (for
example, see [VMware](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/vmware/overview.md)).

To keep users up-to-date on actual system state, Auditor updates the latest snapshot on the regular
basis. Thus, only the latest snapshot is available for ongoing reporting in the product.

However, you may need to generate reports based on the historical data. For that, you must import
the historical snapshots to the database.

To import snapshots, you must be assigned the _Global administrator_ or the _Global reviewer_ role.

Follow the steps to import historical snapshots.

**Step 1 –** Select the monitoring plan you need.

**Step 2 –** Select the required data source and click **Edit data source** on the right to open its
properties.

**Step 3 –** Click **General** on the left.

**Step 4 –** In the **Manage historical snapshots** section, click **Manage**.

**Step 5 –** In the **Manage Snapshots** window, select the snapshots that you want to import — use
the arrows to move the selected snapshots to the **Snapshots available for reporting** list. When
finished, click **OK**.

See the [Role-Based Access and Delegation](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/delegation.md) topic for additional information.
