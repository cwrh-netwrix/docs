# Microsoft Entra ID Monitoring Scope

You can fine-tune Netwrix Auditor by specifying data that you want to exclude from the Microsoft
Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) monitoring scope or modify the way it will be displayed.

Follow the steps to exclude data from the Microsoft Entra ID monitoring scope:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the _%Netwrix Auditor installation folder%\Azure AD Auditing_ folder.

**Step 2 –** Edit the \*.txt files, based on the following guidelines:

- Each entry must be a separate line.
- A wildcard (\*) is supported. You can use \* for cmdlets and their parameters.
- Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.
