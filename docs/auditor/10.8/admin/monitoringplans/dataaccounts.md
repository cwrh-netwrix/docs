# Data Collecting Account

This is a service account that Auditor uses to collect audit data from the monitored items, such as
domains, OUs and servers. NetwrixÂ recommends the creation of a dedicated service account for that
purpose. Depending on the data source your monitoring plan will process, the account must meet the
corresponding requirements in the table below.

Select the account that will be used to collect data for this item. If you want to use a specific
account (other than the one you specified during monitoring plan creation), select account type you
want to use and enter credentials. The following choices are available:

- User/password. The account must be granted the same permissions and access rights as the default
  account used for data collection. See the Data Collecting Account topic for additional
  information.
- Group Managed Service Account (gMSA). You should specify only the account name in the
  domain\account$ format. See the
  [Use Group Managed Service Account (gMSA)](/docs/auditor/10.8/requirements/gmsa.md) topic for additional
  information.
- Netwrix Privilege Secure. Starting with version 10.7, you can implement the integration between
  Netwrix Auditor and Netwrix Privilege Secure. See the
  [Netwrix Privilege Secure](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/settings/privilegesecure.md) topic for additional information.

- Application and secret for Microsoft 365 with modern authentication.

Each data collecting accounts should meet the requirements from the table below, depending on the
data source.
