# Active Directory Monitoring Scope

You can fine-tune Netwrix Auditor by specifying data that you want to exclude from the Active
Directory monitoring scope. You can apply restrictions to monitoring scope via the UI. See the
[Objects](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/activedirectory/overview.md) topic for additional information.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Configure monitoring scope restrictions on the Active Directory monitoring plan
page. See the [Active Directory](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/activedirectory/overview.md) topic for additional information.

Follow the steps to exclude data from the Active Directory monitoring scope:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the _%Netwrix Auditor installation folder%\Active Directory Auditing_
folder.

**Step 2 –** Edit the \*.txt files, based on the following guidelines:

- Each entry must be a separate line.
- A wildcard (\*) is supported. You can use \* for cmdlets and their parameters.
- Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.

When an object is deleted, Auditor does not show any data in the Details column in reports. If you want to see the information on certain attributes of a deleted object, specify these attributes in this file.                                  | `object type:property:` For example, if you want a user’s Description property to be displayed in the reports when a user is deleted, add the following line: `User:Description:`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| propnames.txt              | Contains a list of human-readable names for object types and properties to be displayed in Activity Summaries, reports, and search results.                                                                                                                                                                                     | `classname.attrname=   intelligiblename` For example, if you want the adminDescription property to be displayed in the reports as Admin Screen Description, add the following line: `*.adminDesciption=Admin Screen Description`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
