# Logon Activity

**NOTE:** Prior to configuring your monitoring plan, please read and complete the instructions in
the following topics:

- [Protocols and Ports Required](/docs/auditor/10.8/requirements/ports.md) – To ensure successful data
  collection and activity monitoring configure necessary protocols and ports for inbound and
  outbound connections
- [Data Collecting Account](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/dataaccounts.md) – Configure data collecting accounts as required to
  audit your IT systems

- [Logon Activity](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/logonactivity/overview.md) – Configure data source as
  required to be monitored

Complete the following fields:

| Configure audit settings                           | You can adjust audit settings automatically. Your current audit settings will be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary. This method is recommended for evaluation purposes in test environments. If any conflicts are detected with your current audit settings, automatic audit configuration will not be performed. Do not select the checkbox if you want to configure audit settings manually. See the [Logon Activity](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/logonactivity/overview.md) configuration topic for additional information about audit settings required to collect comprehensive audit data and the instructions on how to configure them.                                                                                   |

| Specify monitoring restrictions                    | Select the users to be excluded from search results, reports and Activity Summaries. To add users to the list, click Add. Then, provide the user name in the domain\user format. For example: _mydomain\user1_. Consider the following: - Use NetBIOS domain name format. - You can provide the "_System_" value to exclude events containing the “_System_” instead of an account name in the “_Who_” column. In addition to the restrictions for a monitoring plan, you can use the \*.txt files to collect more granular audit data. Note that the new monitoring scope restrictions apply together with previous exclusion settings configured in the \*.txt files. See the [Monitoring Plans](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/overview.md)topic for additional information. |

Review your data source settings and click **Add** to go back to your plan. The newly created data
source will appear in the **Data source** list. As a next step, click **Add item** to specify an
object for monitoring. See the
[Add Items for Monitoring](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/datasources.md#add-items-for-monitoring) topic for additional
information.

| Specify the account for collecting data | Select the account that will be used to collect data for this item. If you want to use a specific account (other than the one you specified during monitoring plan creation), select account type you want to use and enter credentials. The following choices are available: - User/password. The account must be granted the same permissions and access rights as the default account used for data collection. See the [Data Collecting Account](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/dataaccounts.md) topic for additional information. - Group Managed Service Account (gMSA). You should specify only the account name in the domain\account$ format. See the [Use Group Managed Service Account (gMSA)](/docs/auditor/10.8/requirements/gmsa.md) topic for additional information. - Netwrix Privilege Secure. Starting with version 10.7, you can implement the integration between Netwrix Auditor and Netwrix Privilege Secure. See the [Netwrix Privilege Secure](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/settings/privilegesecure.md) topic for additional information. |

## Use Netwrix Privilege Secure as a Data Collecting Account

Starting with version 10.7, you can use Netwrix Privilege Secure to manage the account for
collecting data, after configuring the integration. See the
[Netwrix Privilege Secure](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/settings/privilegesecure.md) topic for additional information about
integration and supported data sources. In this case, the credentials will not be stored by Netwrix
Auditor. Instead, they will be managed by Netwrix Privilege Secure and provided on demand, ensuring
password rotation or using temporary accounts for data collection.

Follow the steps to use Netwrix Privilege Secure as an account for data collection.

**Step 1 –** Select the desired item.

**Step 2 –** In the item configuration menu, select Netwrix Privilege Secure as an option for data
collection.

![npsdatacollectingaccount](/images/auditor/10.7/configuration/grouppolicy/npsdatacollectingaccount.webp)

**Step 3 –** Select the type of the Access Policy you want to use in Netwrix Privilege Secure.
Credential-based is the default option. Refer to the
[Netwrix Privilege Secure](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/privilegesecure_accessmanagement)
documentation to learn more about Access Policies.

In this case, you need to provide the username of the account managed by Netwrix Privilege Secure,
and to which Netwrix Auditor has the access through a Credential-based access policy.

**NOTE:** Netwrix recommends using different credentials for different monitoring plans and data
sources.

![npsdatacollectingaccountresourced](/images/auditor/10.7/configuration/grouppolicy/npsdatacollectingaccountresourced.webp)

The second option is Resource-based. To use this option, you need to provide the Activity and
Resource names, assigned to Netwrix Auditor in the corresponding Resource-based policy. Make sure
that you specified the same names as in Netwrix Privilege Secure.

The Resource name in this case is where the activity will be performed. For example, if you grant
the data collecting account the access to a local Administrators group - the resource is the server
where the permission will be granted.

Netwrix Privilege Secure is ready to use as an account for data collection.
