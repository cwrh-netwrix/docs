# SQL Server Monitoring Scope

You can fine-tune Netwrix Auditor by specifying data that you want to exclude from the SQL Server
monitoring scope.

Follow the steps to exclude data from the SQL Server monitoring scope.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the _%Netwrix Auditor install folder%\SQL Server Auditing_ folder.

**Step 2 –** Edit the \*.txt files, based on the following guidelines:

- Each entry must be a separate line.
- A wildcard (\*) is supported. You can use \* for cmdlets and their parameters.
- Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.
