This significantly improves data transfer and minimizes the impact on the target computer performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Configure audit settings                           | You can adjust audit settings automatically. Your current audit settings will be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary. This method is recommended for evaluation purposes in test environments. If any conflicts are detected with your current audit settings, automatic audit configuration will not be performed. Do not select the checkbox if you want to configure audit settings manually.

| Collect data for state-in-time reports             | Configure Auditor to store daily snapshots of your system configuration required for further state-in-time reports generation. See the [State–In–Time Reports](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/reports/types/stateintime/overview.md) topic for additional information. When auditing file servers, changes to effective access permissions can be tracked in addition to audit permissions. By default, Combination of file and share permissions is tracked. File permissions define who has access to local files and folders. Share permissions provide or deny access to the same resources over the network. The combination of both determines the final access permissions for a shared folder—the more restrictive permissions are applied. Upon selecting Combination of file and share permissions only the resultant set will be written to the Audit Database. Select File permissions option too if you want to see difference between permissions applied locally and the effective file and share permissions set. To disable auditing of effective access, unselect all checkboxes under Include details on effective permissions. In the Schedule state-in-time data collection section, you can select a custom weekly interval for snapshots collection. Click Modify and select day(s) of week you want your snapshot to be collected. In the Manage historical snapshots section, you can click **Manage** and select the snapshots that you want to import to the Audit Database to generate a report on the data source's state at the specific moment in the past. You must be assigned the Global administrator or the Global reviewer role to import snapshots. Move the selected snapshots to the Snapshots available for reporting list using the arrow button. The product updates the latest snapshot on the regular basis to keep users up to date on actual system state. Users can also configure Only the latest snapshot is available for reporting in Auditor. If you want to generate reports based on different snapshots, you must import snapshots to the Audit Database. |

| Specify monitoring restrictions                    | Specify restriction filters to narrow your Windows Server monitoring scope (search results, reports and Activity Summaries). For example, you can exclude system activity on a particular objects on all computers. All filters are applied using AND logic. Click Add and complete the following fields: - User who initiated the change: – provide the name of the user whose changes you want to ignore as shown in the "_Who_" column of reports and Activity Summaries. Example: _mydomain\user1_. You can provide the "_System_" value to exclude events containing the “_System_” instead of an account name in the “_Who_” column. - Windows Server which setting was changed: – provide the name of the server in your IT infrastructure whose changes you want to ignore as shown in the "_What_" column of reports and Activity Summaries. Example: _winsrv2016-01.mydomain.local_. - Setting changed: – provide the name for unwanted settings as shown in the "_What_" column in reports and Activity Summaries. Example: _System Properties\*_. You can use a wildcard (\*) to replace any number of characters in filters. In addition to the restrictions for a monitoring plan, you can use the \*.txt files to collect more granular audit data. Note that the new monitoring scope restrictions apply together with previous exclusion settings configured in the \*.txt files.

| Specify monitoring restrictions         | Specify restriction filters to narrow your monitoring scope (search results, reports and Activity Summaries). All filters are applied using AND logic. Depending on the type of the object you want to exclude, select one of the following: - Add AD Container – Browse for a container to be excluded from being audited. You can select a whole AD domain, OU or container. - Add Computer – Provide the name of the computer you want to exclude as shown in the "_Where_" column of reports and Activity Summaries. For example, _backupsrv01.mydomain.local_. Wildcards (\*) are not supported. In addition to the restrictions for a monitoring plan, you can use the \*.txt files to collect more granular audit data.

## Use Netwrix Privilege Secure as a Data Collecting Account

Starting with version 10.7, you can use Netwrix Privilege Secure to manage the account for
collecting data, after configuring the integration. See the
[Netwrix Privilege Secure](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/settings/privilegesecure.md) topic for additional information about
integration and supported data sources. In this case, the credentials will not be stored by Netwrix
Auditor. Instead, they will be managed by Netwrix Privilege Secure and provided on demand, ensuring
password rotation or using temporary accounts for data collection.

Follow the steps to use Netwrix Privilege Secure as an account for data collection.

**Step 1 –** Select the desired item.

**Step 2 –** In the item configuration menu, select Netwrix Privilege Secure as an option for data
collection.

![npsdatacollectingaccount](/images/auditor/10.7/configuration/grouppolicy/npsdatacollectingaccount.webp)

**Step 3 –** Select the type of the Access Policy you want to use in Netwrix Privilege Secure.
Credential-based is the default option. Refer to the
[Netwrix Privilege Secure](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/privilegesecure_accessmanagement)
documentation to learn more about Access Policies.

In this case, you need to provide the username of the account managed by Netwrix Privilege Secure,
and to which Netwrix Auditor has the access through a Credential-based access policy.

**NOTE:** Netwrix recommends using different credentials for different monitoring plans and data
sources.

![npsdatacollectingaccountresourced](/images/auditor/10.7/configuration/grouppolicy/npsdatacollectingaccountresourced.webp)

The second option is Resource-based. To use this option, you need to provide the Activity and
Resource names, assigned to Netwrix Auditor in the corresponding Resource-based policy. Make sure
that you specified the same names as in Netwrix Privilege Secure.

The Resource name in this case is where the activity will be performed. For example, if you grant
the data collecting account the access to a local Administrators group - the resource is the server
where the permission will be granted.

Netwrix Privilege Secure is ready to use as an account for data collection.
