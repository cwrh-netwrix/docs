# SharePoint Online Monitoring Scope

You can fine-tune Netwrix Auditor by specifying data that you want to exclude from the SharePoint
Online monitoring scope.

Follow the steps to exclude data from the SharePoint monitoring scope:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the _%ProgramData%\Netwrix Auditor\Netwrix Auditor for SharePoint
Online\Configuration_ folder and locate your monitoring plan.

If you have several monitoring plans for monitoring SharePoint Online, configure omitlists for each
monitoring plan separately.

**Step 2 –** Edit the \*.txt files, based on the following guidelines:

- Each entry must be a separate line.
- A wildcard (\*) is supported. You can use \* for cmdlets and their parameters.
- Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.
