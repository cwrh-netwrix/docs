# Account Lockout Examiner

## Overview

**Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner** helps IT administrators to discover why an Active Directory
account keeps locking out, so they can quickly identify the lockout reason and restore normal
operations.

You can investigate lockouts originating from the following sources:

- Applications running on workstations
- Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync devices
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access (including mobile devices)
- Mistyped credentials (interactive logons with incorrect password)
- Terminal Server Sessions
- Windows Credential Manager
- Windows Task Scheduler
- Windows Services

## Upgrade recommendations

Since the functionality of older and newer versions does not match one-to-one (see Feature
comparison of Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner 4.1 and 5.x), there is no upgrade path for **Netwrix
Account Lockout Examiner 4.1**.

Though its users can continue working with that older version, we recommend to use the latest
Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner to benefit from the variety of its new features and enhanced
usability.

## Feature comparison of Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner 4.1 and 5.x

Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner 5.1 and later is not an evolutionary update, but rather a total
revamp of version 4.1. Hence, the functionality of the older and newer versions does not match
one-to-one. Feature comparison is provided in the table below.

Users of Account Lockout Examiner 4.1 can continue using that older version, as there is no upgrade
path, just a new installation of the latest version.
