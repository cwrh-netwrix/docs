# Examining Lockouts

To start using **Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner**, download it from Netwrix web site. Once the
download completes, run the executable from your browser menu or from your **Downloads** folder.

To find out why an Active Directory account was locked out, perform the following steps:

1. Set up the auditing as described in [Planning and Preparation](/docs/auditor/10.8/accountlockoutexaminer/configure.md) section.
2. Download the application onto a computer within the domain where lockouts happen.
3. Run the application. When prompted, accept the end-user license agreement.
4. If you wish, select to participate in Netwrix Customer Experience Improvement program. You can
   later change your preference using the product settings (see the next section for details).

5. In the main window, supply the name of the account that was locked out.
6. Specify examiner credentials – the user account that will be used to run the examination, access
   domain controllers, and so on. The account must be a member of the **Domain Admins** group.
7. Click **Examine**.
