# Work with Collected Data

Follow the steps to see collected data.

**Step 1 –** Log on to your ArcSight Logger web interface.

**Step 2 –** On the **Summary** page, select the **Event Summary by Receiver** diagram and click the
**UDP Receiver** segment (Activity Records are imported through UDP Receiver). Select **TCP
Receiver** if you specified TCP protocol for transferring data.

**Step 3 –** On the **Analyze** page that opens, review the search field. Ensure your computer is
listed as Receiver (e.g., "_172.28.156.131 [UDP Receiver]_"). If you imported Activity Records from
more than one Netwrix Auditor Server, add all of them in the search field.

**NOTE:** You might want to modify time range and the fields shown.
