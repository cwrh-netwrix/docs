# Configure ConnectWise

This section describes how to configure settings of the main add-on component, Netwrix Auditor
**ConnectWise Manage Integration Service** that is required for connection to ConnectWise Manage and

**Step 2 –** Navigate to the add-on folder and run ConfigureConnection.exe. Follow the steps of the

Optionally, you can click the Create Test Ticket button — then a test ticket will be created in
ConnectWise Manage to help you verify the connection and ticketing settings you configured.
Its Summary field will contain _[Netwrix Auditor] Test Alert_; its Initial Description field will
contain _This ticket was created to test the functionality of Netwrix Auditor Add-on for ConnectWise
Manage_. Also, the test ticket will have a sample attachment (_TestAttachment.txt_).

**Step 5 –** Finally, at the **Summary** step, review the location of configuration file with the
settings you specified: _C:\Addon\ITSM_CW\ConnectWiseSettings.xml_.

![summary_thumb_0_0](/images/auditor/10.7/addon/connectwise/summary_thumb_0_0.webp)

If needed, you can edit the configuration file manually. See the
[Connection and Ticketing Settings](/docs/auditor/10.8/addon/connectwise/connectionticketingsettings.md) topic for additional
information.

Click **Finish** to restart the add-on service so that the changes can take effect.

## Transferring Configuration

If necessary, you can use configuration file created with this wizard as a template for multiple
managed clients. Perform the following steps:

**Step 1 –** Open the file path provided at the **Summary** step of the wizard.

**Step 2 –** Locate the **ConnectWiseSettings.xml** file and copy it to the add-on folder on another
client's server.

**Step 3 –** Then run ConfigureConnection.exe on that server to launch the configuration wizard and
specify the necessary settings — for example, provide the managed client company name at the
**Service Ticket Routing** step, and so on.
