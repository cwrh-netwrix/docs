# Amazon Web Services

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a wide range of cloud-based services, including solutions and
management tools for virtualization, data storage and hosting, private networking, relational and
NoSQL databases, and many more. AWS CloudTrail is an internal tracking service that records AWS API
calls. Companies leverage this information for analyzing user activity patterns and detecting
potential threats. Unfortunately, collected audit data cannot be used for future reference: AWS
CloudTrail stores events for 7 days allowing administrators and security analysts to review data for
only short time periods.

Netwrix Auditor helps you gain complete visibility into Amazon Web Services user and service
activity. The Add-on for Amazon Web Services extends native AWS CloudTrail auditing and reporting
possibilities. Aggregating data into a single audit trail simplifies activity analysis and helps you
keep tabs on your hybrid cloud IT infrastructure. With Netwrix Auditor, AWS audit data is kept for
much longer periods of time and always ready for review in easy-to-use search interface.

Implemented as a PowerShell script, this add-on automates the acquisition of Amazon Web Services
CloudTrail logs and their transition to Netwrix Auditor. All you have to do is provide connection
details and schedule the script for execution.

On a high level, the add-on works as follows:

- The add-on makes an AWS API call and collects activity events from AWS CloudTrail.
- The add-on processes these events into Netwrix Auditor-compatible format (Activity Records). Each
  Activity Record contains the user account, action, time, and other details.

    Currently, Netwrix Auditor processes details for the following AWS events (other events can be
    imported without details):

    |                |                     |                    |                 |
    | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
    | CreateGroup    | CreateUser          | CreateLoginProfile | CreateAccessKey |
    | DeleteGroup    | DeleteUser          | DeleteLoginProfile | DeleteAccessKey |
    | AddUserToGroup | RemoveUserFromGroup | UpdateLoginProfile | UpdateAccessKey |

- Using the Integration API, the add-on sends the activity events to the Auditor Server, which
  writes them to the **Long-Term Archive** and the **Audit Database**.
