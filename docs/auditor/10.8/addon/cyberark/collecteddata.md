# Work with Collected Data

To leverage data collected with the add-on, you can do the following in Auditor:

- Search for required data. For that, start Auditor client and navigate to **Search**. After
  specifying the criteria you need, click **Search**. You will get a list of activity records with
  detailed information on who did what in the reported time period.

You can apply a filter to narrow down your search results to the Netwrix **API** data source only.

- Also, you can click **Tools** in the upper-right corner and select the command you need. For
  example:
    - If you want to periodically receive the report on the results of search with the specified
      criteria, click **Subscribe**. Then specify how you want the report to be delivered â€“ as an
      email or as a file stored to the file share.
    - To create an alert on the specific occurrences, click **Create alert**.
    - To export filtered data to PDF or CSV, click **Export data**.
