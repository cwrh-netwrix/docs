# Hyper-V SCVMM

Netwrix Auditor is a visibility platform for user behavior analysis and risk mitigation that enables
control over changes, configurations and access in hybrid IT environments to protect data regardless
of its location. The platform provides security analytic to detect anomalies in user behavior and
investigate threat patterns before a data breach occurs.

Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) is a solution for configuring and managing
virtualized infrastructure components across on-premises, service provider, and the Azure cloud
environment. These components include virtualization servers, networking components and storage
resources.

Virtualization teams, Managed Service Providers and other IT professionals need to detect who does
what in the SCVMM-managed virtual infrastructure. For that, a unified audit trail is required,
supporting detailed SCVMM monitoring and effective response to changes.

For that purpose, you can use a specially designed add-on. It works in collaboration with Netwrix
Auditor, supplying data about operations on your SCVMM server to Netwrix database. Aggregating data
into a single audit trail simplifies the analysis, makes activity monitoring more cost-effective,
and helps you keep tabs on your virtual infrastructure.

Major benefits:

- Gain a high-level view of the data you store
- Detect unauthorized activity that might threaten your data

## How It Works

The add-on is implemented as a stand-alone application that collects activity data from Virtual
Machine Manager and sends it to Auditor using the Integration API.

![HIW](/img/product_docs/auditor/10.6/addon/hyperv/diagram.webp)

On a high level, the solution works as follows:

1. An IT administrator configures the Integration API settings to enable data collection and storage
   to the Netwrix database for further reporting, search, etc.

    It is recommended to create a dedicated monitoring plan in Auditor and add a dedicated item of
    **Integration** type to it â€” then you will be able to filter data in reports and search results
    by monitoring plan or item name.

2. On SCVMM side, the IT administrator prepares a dedicated user account for accessing SCVMM server.
   This account requires administrative rights.
3. Then the IT administrator opens the settings.xml configuration file and specifies the necessary
   parameters for add-on operation, including Netwrix Auditor server settings, etc.
4. The IT administrator selects the deployment scenario and runs install.ps1 PowerShell script file
   to deploy and configure the add-on components on the target server.
5. This script creates a Windows scheduled task that will run periodically (every 15 minutes) to
   collect audit data from VMM server.

    See the [Monitoring Scope](/docs/auditor/10.6/addon/hyperv/monitoredevents.md)
    for additional information on the default list of the events supported out-of-the box.

6. The add-on component **HVARunner.exe** starts collecting activity data from VMM. Data
   communication is performed using TCP protocol.
7. The add-on processes this data into Auditor-compatible format (Activity Records). Each Activity
   Record contains the Who-What-When-Where-Action information (that is, initiator's account, time,
   action, and other details).

See the [Integration API](/docs/auditor/10.6/api/overview.md) topic for additional
information on the structure of the Activity Record and the capabilities of the Integration API.

8. The add-on uses the Integration API to send the Activity Records to Auditor Server, where this
   data becomes available for search, reporting and alerting.
9. Users open Auditor Client to work with collected data:
    - Search for file changes using certain criteria
    - Export data to PDF or CSV files
    - Save search results as reports
    - Subscribe to search results
    - Configure and receive alerts

### Add-on Delivery Package

The add-on delivery package is a ZIP archive comprising several files, including DLLs, configuration
and executable files. The latter ones are listed in the table below.

### Accounts and Rights

It is recommended to create a dedicated account for running the add-on.

This account should have the following minimal rights and permissions:

- **Administrator** role in SCVMM
- **Contributor** role in Auditor. See the
  [Role-Based Access and Delegation](/docs/auditor/10.6/admin/monitoringplans/delegation.md)
  topic for additional information.

### Considerations and Limitations

- By default, the add-on is targeted at a single SCVMM server.

- If Auditor Server becomes unavailable for some time, the add-on will reset the last data
  collection and will run it anew during the next scheduled interval.

## Compatibility Notice

The add-on is compatible with:

- Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2019 and 2016
- Netwrix Auditor 9.9 and later
