# Add-Ons

The [Netwrix Auditor Add-on Store](https://www.netwrix.com/netwrix_addons.html) contains free
add-ons developed by Netwrix and your peers in the community. The add-ons help you leverage
integration between your on-premises or cloud applications and Netwrix Auditor.

The list of available add-ons keeps growing because with the new RESTful API, the integration
capabilities of Netwrix Auditor are unlimited. Netwrix encourages users to develop add-ons, upload
them to Netwrix website, and share with community.

Benefits:

- Centralize auditing and reporting of your IT environment — Netwrix unifies auditing of all IT
  systems across your on-premises, cloud or hybrid environment, and enables centralized reporting
  for security and compliance.
- Get the most from your SIEM investment — To maximize SIEM value, Netwrix increases the
  signal-to-noise ratio and feeds your HP ArcSight, Splunk, IBM QRadar or any other SIEM solution
  with much more granular audit data.
- Automate your IT workflows — Automate and improve your change management, service desk and other
  critical IT workflows by feeding them audit data from Netwrix.

Netwrix Auditor Integration API uses HTTPS with an automatically generated certificate for running
requests to its endpoints. By default, add-ons are configured to accept all certificates that is
appropriate for evaluation purposes and allows running the script without adjusting.

Refer to [Security](/docs/auditor/10.6/api/security.md) for detailed instructions
on how to assign a new certificate and enable trust on remote computers.

## Use Add-Ons

Before your start working with the add-on, go through its quick-start guide at
[Netwrix Documentation page](https://www.netwrix.com/documentation.html#netwrix-documentation-page).
Each guide contains detailed instructions for deploying and running the add-on, as well as
prerequisites and configuration settings. Generic steps are described below.

Follow the steps to use the add-on.

**Step 1 –** Check prerequisites. Since the add-ons work only in combination with Netwrix Auditor,
make sure that Netwrix Auidtor and its Audit Database are configured, and roles are assigned
properly.

**Step 2 –** Specify parameters required for add-on operation. Before running or scheduling the
add-on, you should define configuration details like Netwrix Auditor Server host, user credentials,
etc.

**Step 3 –** Choose appropriate deployment scenario, then install and start the add-on. For example,
if the add-on is implemented as a service, you will need to run the installation file that will
deploy and start that service automatically.

**Step 4 –** If you are using a PowerShell-based add-on, run it from a command line: start Windows
PowerShell and provide parameters. First, provide a path to your add-on followed by script
parameters with their values. Each parameter is preceded with a dash; a space separates a parameter
name from its value. You can skip some parameters—the script uses a default value unless a parameter
is explicitly defined. If necessary, modify the parameters as required.

**Step 5 –** Review the add-on operation results. For example, if you are using the add-on that
imports data to Netwrix Auditor, you can search Activity Records in the Netwrix Auditor client.

**Step 6 –** (optional) For PowerShell based add-ons, you can schedule a daily task to ensure your
audit data is always up-to-date.
