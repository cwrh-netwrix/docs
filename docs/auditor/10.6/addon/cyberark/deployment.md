# Deploy the Add-On

Follow the steps to deploy the Add-On:

**Step 1 –** Prepare Auditorfor data processing.

**Step 2 –** Configure Syslog message forwarding in CyberArk.

**Step 3 –** Download the Add-On.

**Step 4 –** Install Add-on.

**Step 5 –** Configure Add-on parameters

## Prepare Auditor for Data Processing

In Auditor client, go to the Integrations section and verify Integration API settings:

1. Make sure the **Leverage Integration API** is switched to **ON**.
2. Check the TCP communication port number – default is **9699**.

See the [Prerequisites](/docs/auditor/10.6/api/prerequisites.md) topic for
additional information.

By default, activity records are written to _Netwrix_Auditor_API_ database which is not associated
with a specific monitoring plan.

Optionally, you can create a dedicated monitoring plan in Auditor. In this case, data will be
written to a database linked to this plan. Target it at Netwrix API data source and enable for
monitoring. Add a dedicated item of _Integration_ type to the plan for data to be filtered by item
name. See the [Integration API](/docs/auditor/10.6/api/overview.md) topic for
additional information.

In such scenario, you will need to specify this monitoring plan in the _naplan_ and _naplanitem_
attributes of the `<AcceptList>` → `<Address>` configuration parameters. See the
[Add-On Parameters](/docs/auditor/10.6/addon/cyberark/parameters.md) topic for
additional information.

## Configure Syslog Message Forwarding in CyberArk

On the CyberArk side, you need to specify the server that will receive Syslog messages from
CyberArk, process them and forward to Auditor Server. This will be the add-on installation server
(the machine where _SyslogService.exe_ runs).

Follow the steps to configure Syslog message forwarding in CyberArk.

**Step 1 –** Log in to your CyberArk system.

**Step 2 –** On the CyberArk server, locate the _%Program Files (x86)%\PrivateArk\Server\Conf_
folder and open the **dbparam.ini** file for editing.

**Step 3 –** Go to the **[SYSLOG]** section and configure the following parameters:

- **SyslogTranslatorFile** – relative path to **Netwrix.xsl** file. You will need to create this
  file manually and copy the content of **SyslogTranslator.sample.xsl** file into it. This sample
  file is provided by CyberArk. By default, it is located in the _%Program Files (x86)
  %\PrivateArk\Server\Syslog_ folder.  
  Place the _Netwrix.xsl_ file there, too, so that default relative path should be _\Server\Syslog_.
- **SyslogServerPort** – communication port of the syslog server (i.e. add-on installation server).
  Default is **514**. Note that if you are using Netwrix Auditor for Network Devices, this port may
  be already in use, and you should provide another one.
- **SyslogServerIP** - IP address of the add-on installation server.
- SyslogServerProtocol – communication protocol for data transfer between CyberArk system and the
  add-on. Specify **UDP** protocol.
- **SyslogMessageCodeFilter** - IDs of events to forward. The add-on will only collect and process
  events you specify in this parameter. For the full list of supported events, see
  [Monitored Events](/docs/auditor/10.6/addon/cyberark/monitoredevents.md). Use
  comma as a separator.

**Step 4 –** Save the **dbparam.ini** file.

## Download the Add-On

**Step 1 –** Download the distribution package **Netwrix_Auditor_Add-on_for_CyberArk_PAS.zip**.

**Step 2 –** Unpack it to a folder on the computer where you plan to deploy the add-on.

_Remember,_ deploy the add-on on the same machine with the Auditor Server.

## Install Add-On

Follow the steps to install the Add-On:

**Step 3 –** Navigate to your add-on package.

**Step 4 –** Unzip the Add-On to a desired folder.

**Step 5 –** Run the installation package.

**Step 6 –** Accept the license agreement and follow the instructions of the setup wizard.

**Step 7 –** On the **Destination Folder** step, specify the installation folder (_C:\Program Files
(x86)\Netwrix Add-ons\<Add-on name>_ by default).

**Step 8 –** Click **Install**.

**Step 9 –** When done, click **Finish**.
