The Access Reviews application is installed with a Builtin Administrator account; "admin" is the
User Name. You will be prompted to set the account's password. It must be eight or more characters
long. After setting the password, you will need to login with the "admin" account.

Using the Configuration interface, the Builtin Administrator account can be disabled once a domain
account has been granted the Administrator role. You can also change the password for the Builtin
Administrator account. See the
[Modify the Builtin Administrator Account](/docs/auditor/10.6/access/reviews/admin/configuration/consoleaccess.md#modify-the-builtin-administrator-account)
topic for additional information.

The Resource Owners interface opens. The first thing that should be done is to configure console
access for domain users and configure notification settings. Select the Configuration tab. See the
[Console Access Page](/docs/auditor/10.6/access/reviews/admin/configuration/consoleaccess.md)
and
[Notifications Page](/docs/auditor/10.6/access/reviews/admin/configuration/notifications.md)
topics for additional information.

The interfaces available to console users are controlled by the role assigned. Owners do not need to
be assigned console access. See the
[URL & Login](/docs/auditor/10.6/access/reviews/admin/login.md) topic for information on
how users will log in and where they are directed after login.

See the [Navigation](/docs/auditor/10.6/access/reviews/admin/navigate.md) topic for
information on each of the interfaces.
