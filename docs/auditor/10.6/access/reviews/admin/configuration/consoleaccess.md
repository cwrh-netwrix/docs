# Console Access Page

Console access is configured through the Configuration > Console Access page. Adding users to the
Access Reviews Console requires the Active Directory service account to be configured.

![Configuration interface showing the Console Access page](/img/product_docs/auditor/10.6/access/reviews/admin/configuration/consoleaccess.webp)

There are two levels of access, or roles, which can be granted to domain users or groups:

- Administrator – Role allows access to all interfaces including the Configuration interface
- Security Team – Role allows access to all interfaces except for the Configuration interface

    - In the Entitlement Reviews interface, this role can only view reviews that the logged in user
      has created.
    - Access can be limited by resource types (File System, SharePoint, or Active Directory)

**CAUTION:** Before disabling the Builtin Administrator account, it is necessary to first assign at
least one domain user account to the Administrator role. Login with another Administrator account to
disable the Builtin Administrator. Failure to do this could result in being locked-out of the
Configuration interface. As an alternative to disabling this account, the password can be changed.
See the [Modify the Builtin Administrator Account](#modify-the-builtin-administrator-account) topic
for additional information.

Once users have been granted console access, they can login with their domain credentials. Console
access is not a requirement for owners to complete Access Reviews. See the
[URL & Login](/docs/auditor/10.6/access/reviews/admin/login.md) topic for information on
how users will log in and where they are directed after login based on their assigned role or lack
of role.

additional information.

additional information.

**Step 1 –** In the Configuration interface on the Console Access page, select the user to be
modified and click Modify. The Console Access wizard opens to the Select Access page.

  the host name for quick reference.

user is to disable their access. See the [Modify Console Users](#modify-console-users) topic for

**Step 1 –** In the Configuration interface on the Console Access page, select the Builtin
Administrator account and click **Modify**. The Builtin Administrator window opens.

The modifications to the Builtin Administrator are processed.

**NOTE:** The new password is encrypted in the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file, in
the `AuthBuiltinAdminPassword` parameter. If you forget the Admin password, you can clear the
`AuthBuiltinAdminPassword` value in the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file. Then use
the default first launch login credentials to set a new password.
