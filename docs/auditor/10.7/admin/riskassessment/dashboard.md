# IT Risk Assessment Dashboard

To access the Risk Assessment dashboard, click the corresponding tile in the main window.

You can add any elements (a dashboard, report, alert, risk, etc.) to the Auditor Home screen to
access them instantly. See the [Navigation](/docs/auditor/10.7/admin/navigation/overview.md) and
[Customize Home Screen](/docs/auditor/10.7/admin/navigation/customizehome.md) topics for additional information.

The IT risks are grouped into the following categories:

- Users and Computers
- Permissions
- Data
- Infrastructure

Within each category there are several key metrics identified by Netwrix industry experts who also
suggested formulas for calculating metrics values. Risks are assessed against these metrics and
displayed with the color indicators in accordance with the level:

- High — red
- Medium — yellow
- Low — green

After reviewing general risks assessment results in each category, you can drill-down to details
covered in the underlying report. To do so, double-click the selected metric or use the View Report
button.

## Customizing Metrics for Your Organization

Default threshold values for risk levels are set in accordance with recommendations of
Netwrixindustry experts, as described in the [How Risk Levels Are Estimated ](/docs/auditor/10.7/admin/riskassessment/levels.md) topic. They
can be, however, easily customized to reflect your organization's internal security policies and
standards. Follow the steps to customize the metrics.

**Step 1 –** In the dashboard pane, select the metric you need and in the **Actions** section on the
right click Modify thresholds.

**Step 2 –** In the displayed dialog, specify new threshold values for risk levels.

**Step 3 –** Click OK to save the settings and close the dialog.

| Servers with unauthorized antivirus software    | Edit the whitelist of permitted antivirus tools. Any other antivirus will be considered a risk factor.                                               |
| Administrative group membership sprawl          | Edit the whitelist of permitted accounts that can be the members of local administrative groups. Any other account will be considered a risk factor. |
