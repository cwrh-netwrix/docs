# Pending Reviews

When your organization performs a review on a resource for which you are the assigned owner, it
means you, the business user or data custodian, need to attest to the access and privileges users
have to your resource. When the Review Administrator creates a new review or starts a new instance
of an existing review, you receive an email notification that includes a link to the your pending
reviews.

Use the **Sign in** link at the bottom to open the My Reviews interface in the Access Reviews
Console.

_Remember,_ your company domain credentials are used to log in.

The My Reviews interface has two pages: Pending Reviews and Review History. See the
[Review History Page](/docs/auditor/10.7/access/reviews/entitlementreviews/reviewhistory.md) topic for additional information.

## Pending Reviews Page

The Pending Reviews page lists all of your resources included in pending reviews.

The information displayed in the table includes:

- Created — Date timestamp for when the review was creation. If it has been run multiple times, this
  is the date timestamp of the last instance.
- Review Type – Type of review:
    - Access – Review user access rights to resources
    - Membership – Review group membership
- Resource Name — The icon indicates the type of resource. The resource name includes its location,
  such as the UNC path for a file system resource, the URL for SharePoint resource, or Group name
  (e.g., [Domain]\[Group]).
- In Progress — Displays a clock icon for an in-progress review
- Last Reviewed — Date timestamp when the last review took place for the resource.

The table data grid functions the same way as other table grids. See the
[Data Grid Features](/docs/auditor/10.7/access/general/datagrid.md) topic for additional information.

Performing a review means you are evaluating the resources. You can leave the resource unchanged or
make recommendations for changes. Consider the following examples:

- In an Access review, you can recommend changes to the type of access granted to the resource.
- In a Membership Review, you can recommend removing group membership from specific users.

_Remember,_ any proposed changes are not committed until the Review Administrator approves the
recommendation and processes those changes.

## Resource Review Page

The Begin Review button opens the Resource Review page to start the review.

The Resource Review page varies based on the type of review; however, there are several common
features:

- Tabs — This page has two tabs:

    - 1 Make changes — Displays current access for the resource.
    - 2 Review changes — Displays changes you recommend making for your review prior to submission

- You are reviewing — Indicates the type of review, the resource being reviewed, and the date
  timestamp for when the review instance was started
- Search — Filters the table for matches to the typed value
- Save Changes — Saves all recommended changes, enabling you to leave the review in progress and
  return at a later time to complete it. It opens the Saving review window, which displays a status
  for the action.
- Remove Access — On the 1 Make changes tab, removes access from the selected trustee(s). Ctrl-click
  can be used for multi-select. Current access blue icon with a checkmark will turn to an empty
  yellow icon.
- Only show changes since last review — Scopes the table to only display those items that have been
  modified since the last review instance
- Previous / Next buttons — Moves between the two tabs
- Submit button — On the 2 Review changes tab, the **Next** button becomes a **Submit** button. This
  submits your review to the Review Administrator.

The content within the table varies, and additional options may appear depending on the type of
review being conducted. See the following sections for step by step instructions:

- [Perform an Access Review](/docs/auditor/10.7/access/reviews/entitlementreviews/review/access.md)
