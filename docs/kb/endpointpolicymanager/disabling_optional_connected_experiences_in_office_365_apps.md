## Overview

This article explains how to disable the **Optional Connected Experiences** feature in Office 365 apps such as Word and Excel by using registry settings or PowerShell scripts. This setting is located under **App** > **File** > **Options** > **Trust Center Settings** > **Privacy Options**.

## Instructions

### Using Registry Settings

To disable the **Optional Connected Experiences** feature, you can manually set the required registry keys:

```plaintext
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\office\16.0\common\privacy]
"disconnectedstate"=dword:00000002
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Always test registry changes on a small number of machines before deploying them widely.

### Using a PowerShell Script

Alternatively, you can use the following PowerShell script to set the registry keys:

```powershell
if((Test-Path -LiteralPath "HKCU:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\office\16.0\common\privacy") -ne $true) {  
    New-Item "HKCU:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\office\16.0\common\privacy" -force -ea SilentlyContinue 
};
New-ItemProperty -LiteralPath 'HKCU:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\office\16.0\common\privacy' -Name 'disconnectedstate' -Value 2 -PropertyType DWord -Force -ea SilentlyContinue;
```

> **NOTE:** Ensure the **`disconnectedstate`** value is set to **`2`** to properly disable the feature.
