# How to Disable AD Authentication on the Portal

## Overview

By default, users can authenticate to the Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) Portal using either Active Directory (AD) credentials or Single Sign-On (SSO). This article explains how to disable AD authentication so that users can only authenticate via SSO.

## Instructions

1. Log in to the Directory Manager Admin Center with an account that has administrative credentials.
2. Click the **Monitor** icon in the top right corner of the screen to navigate to the **Authenticate** portal. A new browser window will appear.
