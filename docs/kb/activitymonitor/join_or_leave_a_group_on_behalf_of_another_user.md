# Join or Leave a Group on Behalf of Another User

## Applies To

## Overview

Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) allows managers and users to request to join or leave groups on behalf of other users. This feature streamlines group membership management, making it easier for managers to add their direct reports to relevant groups or for users to assist peers.
