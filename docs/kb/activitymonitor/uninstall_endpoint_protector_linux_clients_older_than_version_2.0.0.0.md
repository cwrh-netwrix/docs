# Uninstall Endpoint Protector Linux Clients Older Than Version 2.0.0.0

## Question

How can you uninstall Endpoint Protector Linux clients older than version 2.0.0.0?

## Answer

To uninstall an Endpoint Protector (EPP) Linux client older than version 2.0.0.0, use the `uninstall.sh` script that was provided with the same version of the client.

If you no longer have the installer or the uninstall script for that version, submit a support ticket through the [Netwrix Support Portal](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html) and request the kit corresponding to your EPP client version. The support team will provide you with a download link.

After uninstalling the old version, it is recommended to restart the computer.
