# Error: Invalid Credentials—Client ID/Secret Combo May Be Incorrect or Expired

## Symptom

After configuring the API in **Netwrix Activity Monitor** and adding the client ID/secret as a connection profile in **Netwrix Access Analyzer** (formerly **Enterprise Auditor**), the following error appears when trying to get the refresh token from the AD Activity Data Collector:

```
Could not connect: 
One of more errors occurred. 
- Invalid credentials. The Client ID/Secret combo may be incorrect or expired.
```

## Cause

These errors may be caused by any one of the following:

- An expired Client ID/Secret combo
- An open API Configuration window in **Netwrix Activity Monitor**
  
  > **NOTE:** This results in the Client ID/Secret combo being inactive.

## Resolution

If the Client ID/Secret combo is new and not expired, make sure the API Configuration window and **Agent Properties** windows are closed.
