# Sharepoint Online Activity Scan Warning: Unknown Item Type

## Symptom

When you run SPAC System Scans for SharePoint Online in **Netwrix Access Analyzer** (NEA), the system generates the following error message:

```
[8] Unknown item type
```

## Cause

This issue occurs because these are newer event types being collected by **Netwrix Activity Monitor** for which NEA does not have mappings.

## Resolutions

To address this issue, you can do one of the following:

- Ignore the warnings, as they do not inhibit data collection.

- Upgrade to the latest version of **Netwrix Access Analyzer (NEA)**, which should include all SharePoint Online activity types known up until the most recent release date.

  > **NOTE:** If you are on the latest released version of NEA and are still encountering this issue, please submit an escalation to have new event types added to a future release.

- Disable the collection of **Other event types** in **Netwrix Activity Monitor**:

  1. Open **Netwrix Activity Monitor** and navigate to the SharePoint Online file output in the **Monitored Hosts** tab.
  2. On the **Other** tab, uncheck the **Other events** option:
