# SFAM Log Locations

## Summary:
Netwrix File Activity Monitor Log Locations

## Issue:

## Instructions:
The debug log files are located in the following folders:
On the console:
`%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\STEALTHbits\File Monitoring\Logs`

On the agents:
`%ProgramFiles%\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAC\*.log`

SFAM 2.4+ has a function to copy logs from the agents to the console machine, on demand. After you use this function all logs from all SFAM components are in ` %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\STEALTHbits\File Monitoring\Logs` .

There is a single switch to change the logging level. Whenever the level is changed in the UI, the change is propagated and applied immediately to all the agents.
