# Recommended Performance Counters for SAM

SAM Agent comes with performance counters for some internal runtime data. These counters, along with several standard system-wide counters (memory and CPU usage, TCP disconnections, etc.), can help you diagnose performance issues.

The following counters are provided by SAM.

## SAM counters

| Category | Recommended | Counter | Description |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Qumulo |  | `Activity Monitor - Qumulo\Queue Size` | Number of events waiting in queue to be processed |

It makes sense to monitor DNS and Active Directory queries (`DNS Queries...` and `Resolved SIDs...` counters) as they typically contribute the most to the processing time.

In addition to the SAM counters, we recommend collecting the following system counters:

## Prepare for performance monitoring

The SAM performance counters are not registered by default. You need to register them manually.

On each SAM Agent server:

1. Run `cmd.exe` as Administrator.
2. Change the current directory to the agent installation folder (the default path shown here is a file path and must be preserved exactly):

   `cd C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAC`

3. Register the performance counters manifest file:

   `lodctr /M:PerfCounters.man`

   Expected output:

   `Info: Successfully installed performance counters in C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAC\PerfCounters.man`

4. Restart the services:

   ```
   sc stop SBFileMonAgentSvc
   sc stop FPolicyServerSvc
   sc stop CelerraServerSvc
   sc stop SBTLoggingSvc

   sc start SBFileMonAgentSvc
   sc start SBTLoggingSvc
   ```

## Collect performance data

The performance data can be observed or saved using any tool capable of collecting performance counters, for example, Performance Monitor.

Below is a PowerShell script that collects the counters every second and stores them in `perfcounters_SERVERNAME_TIMESTAMP.csv` files. The expected file size per day is about 50MB.

Run the script on each agent server using the following command:

`powershell -file SAM.PerfCollect.ps1`

To stop the script press Ctrl+C.

Script (save it to `SAM.PerfCollect.ps1`):

```powershell
$sampleInterval = 1
$maxSamples = 0
$outputFile = "perfcounters_$($env:COMPUTERNAME)_$(Get-Date -Format "yyyy_MM_dd_HH_mm_ss").csv"

$counters =
    @(

```

## Unregister performance counters

When performance monitoring is not needed anymore, unregister the SAM performance counters.

On each SAM Agent server:

1. Run `cmd.exe` as Administrator.
2. Change the current directory to the agent installation folder:

   `cd C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAC`

3. Unregister the performance counters manifest file:

   `unlodctr /M:PerfCounters.man`

   Expected output:

   `Info: Successfully uninstalled the performance counters from the counter definition XML file PerfCounters.man.`

4. Restart the services:

   ```
   sc stop SBFileMonAgentSvc
   sc stop FPolicyServerSvc
   sc stop CelerraServerSvc
   sc stop SBTLoggingSvc

   sc start SBFileMonAgentSvc
   sc start SBTLoggingSvc
   ```
