# Agent Connection Lost After Upgrading

## Symptom

After upgrading or patching to a new build, the Netwrix Threat Prevention Agent is listed as **Lost Connection** in the Threat Prevention Console.

## Cause

Within the Threat Prevention Console, the host may be listed without domain details. This can occur if the host was replaced with a new server that was named to match the original.

In the `NVMonitorConfig` database, the host may appear multiple times within the **Server** table, both with and without the domain prefix.

> **NOTE:** You can confirm this in SQL Server Management Studio by running the following query:
>
> ```sql
> SELECT * FROM [NVMonitorConfig].[dbo].[Server] WHERE name LIKE '%<Host Name>%'
> ```

## Resolution

1. Stop the **Netwrix Threat Prevention Enterprise Manager (EM)** service from the Windows Services screen.
2. In SQL Server Management Studio, run the following command to remove duplicate or incorrect host entries:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM [NVMonitorConfig].[dbo].[Server] WHERE name LIKE '%<Host Name>%'
   ```
3. Rename the `CertsInfo` folder in the agent's install path. It is recommended to collect this folder when stopping the EM service.

   > **NOTE:** The default path may vary depending on the Threat Prevention version:
   >
   > - New default path: `C:\Program Files\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIWindowsAgent\CertsInfo`
   > - Old default path: `C:\Program Files\STEALTHbits\StealthINTERCEPT\SIWindowsAgent\CertsInfo`

4. Manually uninstall the agent from the affected host.
5. Push the installer back out from the Threat Prevention Console.

The agent should now be listed as **Active**.
