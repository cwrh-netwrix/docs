# Updating the Have I Been Pwnd NTML Hash List

## Overview
The Pwnd Passwords Downloader is a dotnet tool to download all Pwned Passwords hash ranges and save them offline so they can be used without a dependency on the k-anonymity API. For Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer v.10.1 and up, you will need to download NTLM hashes using the Pwnd Passwords Downloader.

## Prerequisites
You will need to install .NET 6 first to be able to install [Pwnd Passwords Downloader](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/PwnedPasswordsDownloader). Only then can you use that tool to get the latest breached hashes from Have I Been Pwned (HIBP). You can download and install .NET 6 from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

**NOTE:** Please note that [Pwnd Passwords Downloader](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/PwnedPasswordsDownloader) is a third party, open source tool, created by the HaveIBeenPwned team, and distributed under a BSD 3-Clause License. You might experience issues during the hash download process, depending on your threading settings or the load on the CloudFlare backend. The Pwnd Passwords Downloader tool will automatically retry to continue downloading the hashes until it fully completes the download process.

HIBP (Have I Been Pwned database) hashes can take up to 30 GB. The resultant database after converting your hashes for Netwrix Threat Prevention is almost the same in size. Make sure that you have enough free space on your disk.
