# Is NTLM Authentication Required for Netwrix Threat Prevention?

## Question

Is NTLM authentication required for Netwrix Threat Prevention (NTP)?

## Answer

Yes, NTP uses NTLM authentication for deploying and upgrading its agents.  
If NTLM is unavailable, the agents can be installed or upgraded manually following the instructions in our Help Center: Manual SI Agent Deployment.

**NOTE:** The next major release of NTP v7.5 will remove all use of NTLM.
