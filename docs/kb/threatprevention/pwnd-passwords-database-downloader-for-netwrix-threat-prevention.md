# Pwnd Passwords Database Downloader for Netwrix Threat Prevention

## Before you start

- Please note that [Pwnd Passwords Downloader](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/PwnedPasswordsDownloader) is a third party, open source tool, created by the HaveIBeenPwned team, and distributed under a BSD 3-Clause License. You might experience issues during the hash download process, depending on your threading settings or the load on the CloudFlare backend. The Pwnd Passwords Downloader tool will automatically retry to continue downloading the hashes until it fully completes the download process.
- HIBP (Have I Been Pwned database) hashes can take up to **30 GB**. The resultant database after converting your hashes for SI is almost the same in size. Make sure that you have enough free space on your disk.

## Instructions

**IMPORTANT.** It is strongly recommended to install .NET 6 first as it only guarantees to get the latest breached hashes from Have I Been Pwned (HIBP).

1. Open Command Prompt, and navigate to your .NET install folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet`).
