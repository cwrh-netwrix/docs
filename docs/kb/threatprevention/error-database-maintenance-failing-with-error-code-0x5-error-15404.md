# Error: Database Maintenance Failing with Error Code 0x5 (Error 15404)

## Symptom

The Netwrix Threat Prevention Database Maintenance job fails with the following error:

```
The job failed. Unable to determine if the owner ("Domain/User") of job SiDbMainJob has server access (reason: Could not obtain information about Windows NT group/user 'Domain/User', error code 0x5 [SQLSTATE42000] (Error 15404))
```

## Cause

The account running the SQL Server Service on the SQL server does not have access to Active Directory, i.e., it is a local account.

## Resolution

1. On the SQL server, launch **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.
2. Select **SQL Server Services** in the navigation pane.
3. Right-click **SQL Server (Instance name)**, then click **Properties**. Navigate to the **Log On** tab, select **Built-in account**, and choose **Network Service** from the drop-down menu.
4. Click **Apply** to save the change and then click **Restart**.
5. Repeat steps 1â€“4 for **SQL Server Agent (Instance name)**.
