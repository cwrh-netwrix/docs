Update the **Logon As** value for each of the services listed above to reflect the password change.

## ConceptConfig

Navigate to each of the locations below. These locations control the SQL database connection and the account used to make that connection. Update the account credentials for all three locations.

1. `C:\Program Files\ConceptSearching\Services\ConceptCollectorService\conceptConfig.exe`
2. `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\conceptQS\bin\conceptConfig.exe`
3. `C:\Program Files\ConceptSearching\Services\conceptIndexer\conceptConfig.exe`

## IIS

Open IIS and click **Application Pools** on the left-hand pane. Right-click on the **conceptQSAppPool** and click **Advanced Settings**.

Find the **Identity** and update the password to match the new password for the account, then restart the application pool.
