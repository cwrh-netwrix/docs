# What usage and license data is sent to Netwrix by Netwrix Data Classification

## Question

I want to know if sensitive data is sent outside of my IT Infrastructure by Netwrix Data Classification.

## Answer

All collected data remains on-prem. The product does send usage statistics, however. This includes the following high level / counter information:

### Top Level

- Licence information (licensee, expiry date, features enabled)
- Number of custom taxonomies
- Number of sensitive data taxonomies (# of our predefined taxonomies that have been enabled)

### Per Source Type

- Number of sources
- Is tagging licenced?
- Number of documents in source
- GB of content in source
- Average text length of content in source
