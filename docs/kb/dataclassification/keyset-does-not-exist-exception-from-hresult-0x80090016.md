# Keyset does not exist ( exception from HRESULT : 0x80090016)

## Scenario

Netwrix Data Classification displays the following error:

```text
Error: There was an error while performing this operation.
Details:
Keyset does not exist ( exception from HRESULT : 0x80090016)
```

## Solution

You can regenerate these machine keys without reinstalling IIS completely. To do that follow the steps below:

1. Rename the files listed below or move them to a different location from `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys\`
   - `iisConfigurationKey 6de9cb26d2b98c01ec4e9e8b34824aa2_GUID`
   - `NetFrameworkConfigurationKey d6d986f09a1ee04e24c949879fdb506c_GUID`
   - `iisWasKey 76944fb33636aeddb9590521c2e8815a_GUID`

2. Backup `applicationhost.config`, then delete everything inside the tags below in `applicationhost.config`. Delete the contents within the `configProtectedData` or `providers` sections:

```xml
<configProtectedData>
    <providers>
    ...
    </providers>
</configProtectedData>
```

3. Open a command prompt in admin mode and run the command below:

```text
"%windir%\system32\inetsrv\iissetup.exe /install SharedLibraries"
```

4. Keys should be recreated in the `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys\` folder. Now the IIS App pool user can be changed.
