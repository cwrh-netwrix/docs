# Documents Are Crawled Successfully with No Text Ex

## Question

Why is Netwrix Data Classification (NDC) crawling your documents successfully, but no text has been extracted?

## Answer

Issues with text extraction can have a range of causes. You can find a summary of text extraction errors in the **Stats** dashboard. Click **Details** to view a breakdown by type of error.

### Steps to Diagnose Text Extraction Failure

1. Enable Collector and OCR tracing and ensure that the log level is set to `Errors, Warnings & Info`.
2. Find a document that has failed text extraction and re-index it.
3. Wait for the **Collect Date Time** to be updated. This can be viewed from the **Page Info** screen.
4. Review the event logs for a detailed error message about the document's collection.

### Intermittent Issues and Backup Extraction Method

If you experience intermittent issues extracting a particular document type, you can enable a backup extraction method through the **Content Type Extraction Methods** screen in **Settings > Text Processing**. For example, enabling iFilter as a backup extraction method for Office OLE files may assist with extracting text from problematic documents.

### Common Issues

- Missing iFilter: If the content type is configured to use iFilters, make sure that the correct iFilter pack is installed on all servers that NDC is installed on.
- Password Protected Documents: Opening password-protected documents is not currently supported.
- Corrupt Files: Try opening the file manually to verify it. Microsoft Office documents can sometimes be recovered by opening and resaving the file.
