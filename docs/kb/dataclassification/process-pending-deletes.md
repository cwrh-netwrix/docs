# Process Pending Deletes

## Situation

The Indexer service is reporting a status of “process pending deletes” in the Netwrix Data Classification service viewer

## Cause

Pending Deletes is a complex operation of removing all data and references to a Document that has been removed or is no longer accessible to Netwrix Data Classification.

Processing these pending deletes involves clearing up a number of Tables in the DB (about 10 queries per single Pending Delete) and Index files on Netwrix Data Classification Server(s).

This is a normal process for Netwrix Data Classification and is typically not a cause for concern. However, if you are noticing the index service only showing this status and affecting overall indexing speed then please review the information below

## Resolution

You can improve Pending Deletes processing performance by stopping the **Collector Service** (Netwrix Data Classification will stop registering new Pending Deletes) and **Classifier Service**, which will free up some extra resources for Indexer Service.
