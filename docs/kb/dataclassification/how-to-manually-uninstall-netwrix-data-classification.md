# How to Manually Uninstall Netwrix Data Classification

## Overview

To manually uninstall Netwrix Data Classification, follow the instructions below.

## Instructions

1. Delete the **SQL database** using SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Uninstall the three Windows services by issuing these commands from the command prompt:

```text
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil /u "C:\Program Files\ConceptSearching\Services\conceptCollectorService\conceptCollectorService.exe""
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil /u "C:\Program Files\ConceptSearching\Services\conceptIndexer\conceptIndexerService.exe"
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil /u "C:\Program Files\ConceptSearching\Services\conceptIndexer\conceptClassifierService.exe"
```

> **NOTE:** You may need to adjust these commands to reflect the locations of your `Windows Folder`, the `version(s) of Microsoft.NET Runtime` installed, and the location of your `conceptSearching installation`.

3. Delete the folder at `C:\Program Files\ConceptSearching`.
4. Delete the folder that contains the `conceptSearching index` ("*.cse") files. **Note** that this is included in the above folder location by default, but can be changed from within the SETUP utility.
