# Error: Unable to Decrypt Encryption Key

## Symptom

Netwrix Data Classification (NDC) prompts the following error in the browser and NDC Service Viewer:

```text
Unable to decrypt encryption key
```

## Causes

One of the following causes is present in your environment:

1. In a DQS environment, different service accounts run the NDC services in different DQS servers.
2. In a Netwrix Data Classification v5.7.0.58 environment, the Data Protection Application Programming Interface (DPAPI) used to share encryption keys between the application servers is misconfigured.

## Resolutions

Refer to the corresponding resolution steps:

1. In a DQS environment, verify that the same service account runs the Netwrix Data Classification services on all DQS servers.
2. Netwrix Data Classification v5.7.1.20 and later versions introduced a check to verify the correct setup of the DPAPI-related registry key. Upgrade your Netwrix Data Classification instance to v5.7.1.20 or later to resolve the issue.
