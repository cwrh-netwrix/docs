How to past this error when the site doesn't require any credentials?

## Answer

This error is gone after adding a specific line in the **Collector Using Agent** field. For that:

1. In **Netwrix Data Classification**, navigate to **Config** -> **Collector** -> **Advanced**.
2. Add the following line in the **Collector Using Agent** field:

```text
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Sa   
```
