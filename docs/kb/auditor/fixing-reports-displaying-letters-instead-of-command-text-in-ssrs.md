## Solution
The issue is with Internet Explorer's handling of permissions. To fix the issue you need to add the reporting server to the **Trusted Sites** and disable the **Protected Mode** for Admins on the Netwrix Server.

### Adding Reporting Server to the Trusted sites
To do this, follow these steps:

1. In **Internet Explorer**, click **Tools**, then **Internet Options**. Go to the **Security** tab.
2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
3. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the IP address of the Netwrix Server, and then click **Add**.
4. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

### Disabling Protected Mode for Admins
This operation can be done using Group Policy. You need to locate the Group Policy that applies to the Admins of the Netwrix Server. To disable Protected Mode, follow these steps:

1. Launch the **Group Policy Management Console** and edit a policy.
2. Expand: **User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Internet Explorer > Internet Control Panel > Security Page > Internet Zone**
3. Double-click **Turn On Protected mode**
4. Select `ENABLED`
5. Select `DISABLED` from the PROTECTED MODE selection box.
