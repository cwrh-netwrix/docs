# Password expiration notifier stopped showing resul

After excluding some OUs from the scope by modifying the `omitoulist.txt` file, you may notice that Netwrix Password Reset has stopped showing any results for any monitoring plans, even after reverting changes back.

A possible cause is blank lines accidentally added at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the `omitoulist.txt` file. To fix that, open the file in any text editor and remove the blank lines. On the screenshot below, the lines 1, 7 and 9 must be removed.

1. Open `omitoulist.txt` in any text editor.
2. Remove any blank lines at the beginning, middle, or end of the file.
3. Save the file.
