# Can’t Find Info about Largest Files in the Files and Folders Created Report

## Question

I tried to detect why there is a large increase in storage for one of our new servers. I ran the **Files and Folders Created Report**, but it doesn’t show the size of files and folders. How can I see the size?

## Answer

To see the size of your largest files, use the **Largest Files Report**, which can be found under **Reports** > **File Servers** > **File Servers - State-in-Time**.

This report shows:

- Up to 1000 largest files within a specified `UNC` path
- File sizes
- Creation / modification dates
- Owner names
