# Failed Logon Attempts after Recent Service Account Password Change

## Symptom

A Netwrix Auditor service account is generating failed logon events after the recent password change.

## Cause

The service account password was not updated for separate collectors (Netwrix Password Reset, Event Log Manager and Inactive User Tracker) with monitoring plans set up.

## Resolution

A service account password is not propagated automatically in Netwrix Password Reset, Event Log Manager and Inactive User Tracker collectors.

For Event Log Manager, Inactive User Tracker and Netwrix Password Reset:

1. Open the corresponding application, select your monitoring plan and click **Edit**.
2. In the **General** tab, specify new credentials for your service account.

Refer to the following screenshots for reference on service accounts credentials to be changed in case you've reset a password in Netwrix Auditor:
