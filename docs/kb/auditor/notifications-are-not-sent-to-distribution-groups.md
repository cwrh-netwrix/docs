  Notifications are not delivered when a distribution group is set as the
  recipient because Exchange requires authenticated senders for distribution
  groups. This article explains two solutions: enable SMTP authentication in the
  Netwrix Auditor management console or disable the authentication requirement
  on the distribution group.

# Notifications are not sent to distribution groups

If you specify a user's e-mail address as a recipient, notifications work. If you specify a distribution group as the recipient, notifications do not come through.

This is related to authentication settings.

By default, even if the Exchange receive connector accepts anonymous SMTP, sending to distribution groups requires clients to be authenticated.

There are two solutions:

1. Configure SMTP authentication in the settings of the **Netwrix Auditor** management console

2. Disable the "require authentication" option in distribution group options as follows

   1. Launch **Exchange Management Console**  
   2. Navigate to **MS Exchange - Recipient configuration - Distribution groups**  
   3. Select the required distribution group and open its **Properties**

   4. Go to **Mail Flow Setting** tab  
   5. Select **Message Delivery Restrictions** from the list and open its **Properties**

   6. Uncheck **Require that all senders are authenticated** and click **OK**

   Alternatively, you can run the following command via Exchange Management Shell:

   ```powershell
   Set-Mailbox -RequireSenderAuthenticationEnabled $false -Identity %group%,
   ```

   where ` %group% ` is like `dynamic.group@example.com`
