# Fine Grained Policy and account expiration

Can Netwrix Password Reset only report on users with the Fine Grained Policy settings enabled if you need to monitor account expiration as well?

No â€” this feature is not available in the current product version. You can use the following workaround:

1. Create a Managed Object to monitor the Fine Grained Policy users.
2. Create a separate Managed Object to monitor account expiration.
