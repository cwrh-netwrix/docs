# Connection to Microsoft 365 Tenant in Netwrix Auditor Completes with Error Validating Your Account’s Rights and Permissions

## Symptom

When trying to connect to Office 365 Tenant using modern authentication, the following error appears:

```
Error validating your account’s rights and permissions: Tenant name 'Tenant_name' specified is not a valid DNS name.
```

## Cause

The issue occurred due to incorrect Office 365 tenant credentials provided in Netwrix Auditor.

## Resolution

Make sure you provided the same parameters in a Netwrix Auditor monitoring plan and Microsoft Office 365 Admin center.

1. **Tenant name** in Netwrix should equal the `Directory (tenant) ID` in Microsoft Office 365 Admin center.
2. **Modern authentication application ID** should equal `Application (client) ID` in Microsoft Office 365 Admin center.
