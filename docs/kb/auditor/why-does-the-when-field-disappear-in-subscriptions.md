# Why Does the 'When' Field Disappear in Subscriptions?

## Question

When creating a search-based subscription, the **WHEN** field disappears in the list of available filters. Where can I configure subscription delivery frequency?

## Answer

This is normal behavior and Netwrix Auditor is working as expected. The **WHEN** of a subscription is based on the schedule of that subscription.

For example, if you want the **WHEN** to equal **YESTERDAY**, then you would create your subscription with a **Schedule** of **Daily**.

For additional information on how to create subscriptions, refer to the following article: Administration â€“ Subscriptions.
