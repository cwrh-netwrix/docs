It can happen if the snapshot reporting feature is disabled and/or no AD snapshots were uploaded to the database.

In order to fix this issue please open the Netwrix Auditor and make sure that snapshot reporting feature is enabled under **Active Directory | Reports | Snapshot Reports (State-in-Time Reports)** tab.

Otherwise, on the same page you can import the snapshot you want to report on to the database. In order to do this, transfer the snapshot from the **"All available snapshots"** to the **"SNapshots available for reporting"** column and then click the **"Apply"** button.
