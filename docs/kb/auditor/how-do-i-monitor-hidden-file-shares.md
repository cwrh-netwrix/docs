# How do I monitor hidden file shares?

If you specified **Computer** as an Item in the Netwrix Auditor Windows File Servers data source, Netwrix Auditor monitors all available file shares on that server, except for the hidden ones (ending with `$` sign). If you want to monitor a specific hidden share, you need to add it explicitly, specifying its full UNC path, e.g. `\server\hiddenshare$`.

If you would like to audit all hidden shares on the server, check the corresponding option at the **Scope** tab of your **Computer** item:

**NOTE:** It is not recommended to specify the system drive (`\server\c$`) as an Item. This will force Netwrix to audit local folders including the system ones that produce a lot of noise and degrade the product performance.
