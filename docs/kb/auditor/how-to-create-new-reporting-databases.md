# How to create new reporting databases

How do I create new reporting databases?

## Answer

You can either back up and delete the existing Netwrix databases or just delete them, depending on your preference.

### Steps

1. Back up and delete the existing Netwrix databases with `SQL Management studio`, or just delete them depending on your preference.
2. Create a new database for each audited system by re-applying the SQL report settings for your managed object in the Netwrix Auditor console:
   - **Netwrix Auditor console | Manage Objects | Your Manage object | Audited System (for example Active Directory) | Reports | Report settings tab on the right | Apply button**
