# When is the Password Expiration Notification sent?

When is the password expiration notification sent?

---

**Netwrix Password Reset uses the following algorithm to calculate when to send a password expiration notification:**

**Sending date** = *Last password change* (value of the account's `PwdLastset` attribute) + *Maximum password age* (`AD` value) â€“ *Number of days before the upcoming password expiration* (Netwrix Password Reset value).
