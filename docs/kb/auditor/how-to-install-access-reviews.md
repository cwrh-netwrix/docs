# How to Install Access Reviews

## Question

Where can I find Netwrix Auditor Access Reviews installation wizard?

## Answer

Access Reviews can be accessed via the Netwrix Auditor Download Manager. You can get Download Manager by downloading the Netwrix Auditor or the Netwrix Data Classification trial version here: [Netwrix Products](https://www.netwrix.com/products.html).

> **NOTE:** Once you apply your license, your trial version will switch to a standard version.

Launch the Netwrix Auditor Download Manager executive and select the appropriate deployment option.  
In case you're planning the on-premise deployment, click **On-premises Deployment**, select the suitable package and click **Download**. Once you've downloaded the package, the Access Reviews Setup executive will be available in the downloaded archive.

For the VM deployment, proceed with the **Virtual Appliance** option and select the suitable package. Netwrix Auditor Access Reviews will come preinstalled for the VM of your choice.
