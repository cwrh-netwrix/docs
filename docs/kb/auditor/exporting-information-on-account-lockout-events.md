# Exporting information on account lockout events

Can I export information on account lockout events for audit purposes?

---

The Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner console does not have an export feature. However, all lockout information is stored in the `allinfo.xml` file located in the product installation directory. It can be easily parsed by a third-party tool or script to get the required information. However account names are not stored in the `allinfo.xml`; all accounts are referred to as SIDs.

Netwrix also has another product called Netwrix Event Log Manager for this purpose. This product is able to collect event log entries from multiple computers across the network and centrally store all events in a central location in a compressed format.
