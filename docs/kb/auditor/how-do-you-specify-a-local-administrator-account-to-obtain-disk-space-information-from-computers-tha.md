# How do you specify a local administrator account to obtain disk space information from computers that are not part of the domain?

---

Disk Space Monitor has no option to monitor computers that are not joined to the domain. All monitored computers must be part of the domain.

You can however install the software on a stand-alone PC using a local administrator account. You will need to logon to Windows using a local administrator account, install Disk Space Monitor and configure the product to monitor the local computer (**Start | Programs | NetWrix Disk Space Monitor Full Version | Configurator | Click Add and specify the stand-alone PC name**).
