# Infognition ScreenPressor Installed in Netwrix Auditor Server and Audited Servers

## Question

After Netwrix Auditor was deployed in the environment, the Infognition ScreenPressor application was installed both in the Netwrix Auditor server and audited servers. What is Infognition ScreenPressor? Is Infognition ScreenPressor a part of the Netwrix Auditor solution?

## Answer

Infognition ScreenPressor is a codec used to record and playback the User Activity videos. The codec is installed automatically in the Netwrix Auditor server and the monitored servers. Uninstalling this application might lead to User Activity performance issues.

> **NOTE:** If you do not implement User Activity monitoring in your environment, it is safe to uninstall the codec.

In case the codec was deleted, and you'd like to reinstall the codec, you can download it using the following link: [Infognition ScreenPressor Codec ⸱ Netwrix](https://www.netwrix.com/download/ScreenPressorNetwrix.zip).
