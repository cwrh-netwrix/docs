## Causes

- Errors resolving a DNS or NetBIOS name.
- The RPC service or related services may not be running.
- Network connectivity issues.
- File and printer sharing is not enabled.
- TLS 1.2 is not set up.
- Insufficient server resources.

## Resolutions

- Configure firewall policies.

  **NOTE:** If you are using Windows Firewall, open the **Group Policy Object Editor** snap-in (`gpedit.msc`) to edit the Group Policy object (GPO) used to manage Windows Firewall settings in your organization. Navigate to **Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Network** > **Network Connections** > **Windows Firewall**, and open either **Domain Profile** or **Standard Profile**, depending on which profile you are using. Enable the following exceptions:

  - Allow Remote Administration Exception
  - Allow File and Printer Sharing Exception

- Review the hostname and IP address. Verify the machine is turned on and reachable. Also make sure the FQDN is resolving to the correct IP address.

- Verify that the **Windows Management Instrumentation** service is running and set to auto-start after restart.

  > **NOTE:** If you see the following error in the Event Viewer while checking **Event Viewer (Local)** connection to another computer, enable inbound rules (COM+ Network Access and all rules in the Remote Event Log Management group) on the target computer. Refer to the following article for additional information: Configuration − Logon Activity Ports: Configure Windows Firewall Inbound Connection Rules ⸱ v10.6.

  For additional information on Windows Firewall configuration, refer to: Logon Activity Ports — Configure Windows Firewall Inbound Connection Rules · v10.6.

- Verify that the **TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper** service is running and is set to auto-start after restart.

- Verify the **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** service is running and set to auto start after restart.

  To check event logs on the target domain controller:

  1. Log on to the computer where Netwrix Auditor is installed using the Netwrix data processing account.
  2. Go to **Start > Run** and type `eventvwr`, then click **OK**.
  3. Right-click **Event Viewer (Local)** and select **Connect To Another Computer**.
  4. In the **Select Computer** dialog window, type the name of the domain controller reporting the error in the **Another Computer** entry field. Click **OK** to connect to the domain controller.
  5. Select the **Security** log. The list should show valid event entries.
