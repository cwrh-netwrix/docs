# The Email Address column in the Enrollment report

When you run the Enrollment report, the Email Address column fields are blank for all user accounts. What should this column show and what can you do to make this work?

The **Email Address** column returns the email address used for **Additional authentication using the user email** feature.

An email with a unique link to the password reset page is sent to this address after the user answers secret questions. The user then should follow the link to complete password reset. The Email Address field contains data for the enrolled users only, because this email is specified during the enrollment procedure if the Authentication policy feature is enabled.

To enable this feature:

1. On the **Administrative portal - Settings - Authentication Policy** tab, select the **Additional authentication using the user email** check box.
