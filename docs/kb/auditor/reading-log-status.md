# Reading log status

In NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner Console, a domain controller has a yellow exclamation mark in front of the **DC Name** column of the **Monitored Domain Controllers** grid. Connection status is shown **Reading log**. Lockout events from this domain controller cannot be read by the program as well.

## Symptom

This issue can appear either right after the NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner installation, or after the NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner Service restart. The program is referring to the event logs created earlier, before the installation or restart, and fails to complete reading the logs.

## Resolution

To fix the issue, do the following:

1. Open **Registry Editor**: navigate to Start - Run, enter `regedit` and click **OK**.
2. In the left pane, navigate to `HKLM Software[Wow6432Node]NetWrixAccount Lockout Examiner`. The step Wow6432Node is only applied to x64 OS.
3. In the right pane, double-click `readLog`, specify `0` in the Value data field and click **OK**.
4. In NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner Console main menu bar, navigate to **File - Settings** and click **OK** to apply registry changes.
