# How to audit File Servers with enabled User Account Control

Why Netwrix Auditor cannot configure audit settings for File Servers Managed Object?

---

Most likely, this is due to enabled User Account Control. â€‹In this case the Netwrix Auditor System Health log contains the following error:
*Cannot configure audit settings for the object `&lt;Managed Object name&gt;`: A required privilege is not held by the client.*

To resolve this issue, do the following:

1. If your target server is not in a domain, create a user that is not a member of the **BUILTINAdministrators** group. Grant all required rights and permissions to the account.
2. Enable User Account Control for local connections only and disable it for remote connections.
