# How to configure notifications on service account password expiration

Netwrix Password Reset sends emails to AD users when their passwords are about to expire. How can this be configured for the service accounts that run server-based applications? How can the IT staff be notified of an impending service account password expiration?

1. In Netwrix Password Reset, select the **Send report to the users' managers** check-box.
2. Using the **Active Directory Users and Computers** tool, specify the manager's email address for a service account. The manager will be notified about the service account password expiration.
