# How to Find Video Recording Files

## Question

In some cases, you might want to find your video recording files on the computer. For example, to share them or move them to another PC. Where are the files stored physically?

## Answer

The User Activity video is already a video file `.avi`, you only need to locate the file and copy it. Follow the steps below to locate the files:

1. In **Netwrix Auditor**, navigate to **Settings** -> **Long-Term Archive** and find the path to your Video Recording files under **Location for sessions recordings**.
2. Copy the path and paste it into **File Explorer**.
3. Once there you will see the names of the computers being monitored, the users name, then folders by year, then by Month and day together.
