2. When providing credentials for the Netwrix Auditor Event Log Manager monitoring plan, the following dialog appears:

```
The specified account cannot be verified. The user name or password is incorrect.
```

## Cause

This error occurs when using o365 SMTP Server that requires TLS 1.2 enabled on the computer that hosts Netwrix Auditor Server and on the target server(s).

## Resolution

Follow the steps below to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that TLS 1.2 is enabled on the target server:
   - Open **Registry Editor** and navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Client\Enabled`.
   - If enabled, the key value should be `"1"`.
   - For additional information about TLS enabling, refer to the following article: Сonnection Issue when TLS 1.2 Is Required.

2. Configure all .NET Framework keys on the Netwrix Auditor and target server(s). Use the [download link](https://netwrix.com/download/products/KnowledgeBase/TLSRegkey.reg) to configure registry keys automatically. Run the file on your Auditor Server and all target servers.

3. On the target server, open **Registry Editor** and navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL`. Change the **EventLogging** value to `"7"`.

4. If the settings listed above are configured correctly, but the issue persists, also consider checking the **WinHTTP** settings. On the target server, open **Registry Editor** and check the following registry keys:

   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\WinHttp\DefaultSecureProtocols = (DWORD): 0xAA0`
   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\WinHttp\DefaultSecureProtocols = (DWORD): 0xAA0`

5. Restart both: Netwrix Auditor and the target server(s).
