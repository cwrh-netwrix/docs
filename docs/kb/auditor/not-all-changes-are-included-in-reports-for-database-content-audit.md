# Not all changes are included in reports for Database content audit

When you perform bulk inserts, not all modified rows are reported. How do you change this?

---

In the **SQL Server data source settings** there is a value that defines the number of data changes per SQL transaction to be included in a report. By default it is set to `10`.
