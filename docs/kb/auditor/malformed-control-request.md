# Malformed control request

When I send remote control e-mail to Account Lockout Examiner to unlock user account, I get a reply saying:

**Malformed control request**

---

Account Lockout Examiner requires a specific structure of an e-mail to unlock the user account.

It should be a reply to lockout notification and shall have the code specified after `UNLOCK:` keyword.

For example:

Make sure that:
1. you reply to a lockout notifications
2. `UNLOCK:` keyword is specified
3. the quoted e-mail was not changed
4. you reply in UTF-8 encoding.
