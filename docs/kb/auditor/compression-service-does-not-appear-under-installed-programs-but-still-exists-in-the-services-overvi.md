# Compression Service Does Not Appear Under Installed Programs but Still Exists in The Services Overview

## Symptom

After uninstallation of Netwrix Compression Service, it does not appear under **Programs and Features** in the Control Panel, but still exists in the **Services Overview**.

## Cause

Compression service components were not completely removed during uninstallation.

## Resolution

You can manually delete the Service and its components. For that:

1. Open the **Services** snap-in and open properties of the problematic service.
2. Copy the full name of the service and the path to executable, for example, to a **Notepad** document.

3. Run the command prompt as administrator and run the following command:

   ```bat
   sc delete <service_name>
   ```

   where the `<service_name>` is the full name of the service you copied on the step 2.
4. After that, navigate to the file path you copied earlier and delete all the files.
