# How to configure the product to send two user notifications instead of three

Netwrix Password Reset sends three user password expiration notifications. Is it possible to configure the product to only send two notifications instead?

In order to do this, configure user notifications as follows:

1. Configure the first notification to be sent when the password expired in `X` days.
2. Configure the second notification to be sent when the password expires in `Y` days.
3. Configure the third notification to be sent when the password expires in `Y` days as well. In other words, put the same value in the second and the third notification field.
