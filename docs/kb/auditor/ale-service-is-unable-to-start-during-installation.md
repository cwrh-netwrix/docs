# ALE service is unable to start during installation

## Cause

NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner uses .NET Framework and requires .NET 3.5 SP1.  
The message appears if only NET 3.5 is installed.

## Resolution

1. Make sure that .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 is installed.
2. If it is installed, reinstall it or upgrade to .NET 4.

Also:
1. Verify that the account specified during installation is a local admin.
2. Check that there are no restrictive policies for this account to run services.
3. Try entering another local admin or domain admin account during the installation.
