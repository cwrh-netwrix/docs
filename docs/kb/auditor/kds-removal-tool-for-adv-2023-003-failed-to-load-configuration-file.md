## Cause

The KDS Removal tool is unable to locate the Netwrix Auditor configuration file.

## Solution

1. Check the location of the configuration file (located by default in `C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Auditor\AuditCore\ConfigServer\Configuration.xml`). If a Working Folder migration was previously done, check the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Netwrix Auditor\DataPathOverride` key for a path.

2. Open the folder you've extracted the KDS tool to. Open the `config.json` file using a text editor (e.g., Notepad++). In the **"DataPathKey"** section of the file, specify the path to your Working Folder in the **"DefaultValue"** line. Refer to the following code blocks for an example.

Original snippet (uses environment variable):

```json
"DataPathKey": 
    {
        "KeyPath": "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Netwrix Auditor\DataPathOverride",
        "KeyName": "",
        "DefaultValue": "%PROGRAMDATA%\Netwrix Auditor"
    },
```

Change it to a full path (example):

```json
"DataPathKey": 
    {
        "KeyPath": "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Netwrix Auditor\DataPathOverride",
        "KeyName": "",
        "DefaultValue": "C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Auditor"
    },
```

3. Save changes and run the tool again.
