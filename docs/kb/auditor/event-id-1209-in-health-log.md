# Event ID 1209 in Health Log

## Symptom

One of the following error messages under Event ID 1209 appears in the Health Log for your SharePoint monitoring plan:

```text
Unable to obtain the list of SharePoint groups for site collection with ID '{0}':
Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED)).
```

```text
Unable to obtain the list of SharePoint groups for site collection with ID '{0}':
Access to this Web site has been blocked.
```

## Causes

The security settings in the audited SharePoint farm do not allow for complete audit data collection. Netwrix Auditor was unable to get a list of security groups from the audited site collection due to one of the following reasons:

1. The web application hosting the target site collection has insufficient permissions.
2. The affected site collection has the **Locked ‚Äî No Access** status.

## Resolutions

1. Cause #1 ‚àí In SharePoint Central Administration, navigate to **Web Applications** > **`%affected_web_application%`** > **User Permissions**, and verify the security settings. The minimum required permissions are **Manage Web Site**.
2. Cause #2 ‚àí In SharePoint Central Administration, navigate to **Application Management** > **Configure Quotas and Locks** > **`%affected_web_application%`**, and change the status to **Not locked**.
