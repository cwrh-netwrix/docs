# Symbolic Link Cannot Be Followed Error in File Server Monitoring Plan

## Symptom

You see the following error in the Health Log for your File Server monitoring plan:

```
Error: 0x80049610
The symbolic link cannot be followed
Make sure the local-to-local, local-to-remote, remote-to-local, and remote-to-remote symbolic link evaluations are enabled on the computer that hosts Netwrix Auditor Server.
```

The error shows only during State-in-Time data collection.

## Cause

Symbolic links (symlinks) are disabled or misconfigured.

## Resolution

Enable all symbolic link types.

1. On your **Netwrix Auditor server**, open an elevated Command Prompt and run:

    ```text
    fsutil behavior query SymlinkEvaluation
    ```

    Once executed, you'll see the settings for symbolic links (enabled or disabled).

2. To enable a symlink type, run the following command:

    ```text
    fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2L:1
    ```

    The `R2L:1` stands for remote-to-local enabled. You can change `R` to `L` and vice versa to enable the disabled symlink.
