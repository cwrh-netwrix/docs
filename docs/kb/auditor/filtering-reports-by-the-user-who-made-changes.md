# Filtering reports by the user who made changes

Is there a way of seeing all the changes that have been made to a particular account and reflected in the daily reports, without having to go through each report individually?

## Answer

Yes, with the **Advanced Reports** feature you can filter data in reports by different fields, including the **User name** field. This feature requires **Microsoft SQL Server** installed, either its full version or free version of **Microsoft SQL Express with Advanced Services**.

For instructions on installing **Microsoft SQL Server** and configuring the **Reporting Services**, refer to the following technical article: https://www.netwrix.com/download/documents/Configuring_Microsoft_SQL_Server_Reporting_Services_Technical_Article.pdf.
