## Answer
The issue occurs because IIS cannot display images because of configuration.  
To address the issue, enable the **Static content** feature within IIS.

**In Windows 7:**

1. Go to **Control Panel - Programs and Features - Turn Windows features on or off**.  
2. Navigate to **Internet Information Services (IIS) - World Wide Web Services - Common HTTP Features**.  
3. Make sure that the checkbox in front of the **Static content** is enabled.

**In Windows 2008**:

1. Navigate to **Server Manager - Roles - Web server**, find the Role services in the right pane, click **Add role services**.  
2. Enable **Static content** under **Common HTTP Features**.
