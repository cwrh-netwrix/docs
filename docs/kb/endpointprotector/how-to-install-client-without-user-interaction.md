# How to Install Client Without User Interaction

## Question
Can you install the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client, without user interaction?

## Answer
Yes, you can install the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client via the command line interface with administrative privileges. This method installs the client without user interaction and does not require a system restart.

Run the following command:

```batch
msiexec /i "C:\Users\eppuser1\Desktop\EPP Client\EPPClientSetup.6.2.4.2000_x86_64_[a=192.168.43.115].msi" /norestart /qn /l*v "C:\EPP_inst.log"
```

- ` /qn` performs a silent installation.
- ` /norestart` prevents a computer restart after installation is complete.
