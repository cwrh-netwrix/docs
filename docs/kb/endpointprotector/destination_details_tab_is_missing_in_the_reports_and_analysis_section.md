# Destination Details Tab Is Missing in the Reports and Analysis Section

## Question

Why is the Destination Details tab missing in the Reports and Analysis section?

## Answer

The **Destination Details** tab, which lists the website where a monitored file was uploaded, may be missing from the **Reports and Analysis** section in the **Endpoint Protector Console**.

If the **Destination Details** tab is missing, enable the **Reporting V2** setting in **System Configuration** > **System Settings**.

After enabling **Reporting V2**, the **Destination Details** field will be selectable and viewable in the Reports and Analysis section.

> **NOTE:** The **Reporting V2** setting should always be enabled, as it provides enhanced features compared to Reporting V1.
