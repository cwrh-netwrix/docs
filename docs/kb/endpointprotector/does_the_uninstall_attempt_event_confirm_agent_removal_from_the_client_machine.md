# Does the "Uninstall Attempt" Event Confirm Agent Removal from the Client Machine?

## Question

Does the **Uninstall Attempt** event confirm that the agent was removed from the client machine?

## Answer

No, the **Uninstall Attempt** event does not confirm successful agent removal. There is no confirmation of the final result of an attempted agent removal because if the removal is successful, the agent is no longer present to communicate back to the Endpoint Protector Server.

> **NOTE:** If the agent still "PINGs" the server after an **Uninstall Attempt** event, this indicates that the agent removal process failed.
