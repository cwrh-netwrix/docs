# Resolve HSTS Web Browser Errors When Accessing Websites

## Overview

This article explains how to resolve HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) errors that may occur in web browsers when accessing websites. These errors can often be resolved by clearing the browser cache and restarting the browser.

## Instructions

1. Clear the cache in your web browser.
2. Restart the web browser.

After completing these steps, the HSTS error should be resolved. However, if the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) option is being switched on and off by an Endpoint Protector (EPP) administrator, the error may reappear. In this case, repeat the steps above to resolve the issue.
