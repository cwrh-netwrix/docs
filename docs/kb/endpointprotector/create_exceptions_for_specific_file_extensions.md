# Create Exceptions for Specific File Extensions

## Overview

This article explains how to exclude specific file extensions from being traced, scanned, or shadowed in Endpoint Protector. Creating exceptions for certain file types can help you manage which files are monitored by **Device Control** policies.

## Instructions

1. In the **Endpoint Protector Management Console**, go to **Device Control** > **Global Settings**.
2. Locate the **File Tracing and Shadowing** section.
3. For each action (tracing, scanning, or shadowing), find the **Exclude Extensions** field.
4. Enter the file extensions you want to exclude (for example, `.mp3;.exe;`) in the respective field.
5. Click **Save** to apply the changes.
