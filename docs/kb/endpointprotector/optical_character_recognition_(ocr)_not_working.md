# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Not Working

## Question

Why is Optical Character Recognition (OCR) not working in Endpoint Protector?

## Answer

OCR may not be working in Endpoint Protector due to low image quality, insufficient resolution, poor contrast, or an outdated client version.

To resolve OCR issues, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure the image quality is high, with a recommended minimum of **150 dpi** (dots/pixels per inch). Good contrast in the image also improves OCR accuracy.
2. To check the dpi of an image on Windows, open the image in **Paint**, go to **File** > **Properties**, and review the **Resolution** field (in dpi).
3. Make sure you are using the latest version of the Endpoint Protector client.
