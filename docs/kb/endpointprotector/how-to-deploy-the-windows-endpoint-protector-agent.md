# How to Deploy the Windows Endpoint Protector Agent

## Manual Installation

If installing the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Agent on a small number of clients or for testing, the agent can simply be installed by downloading the MSI Package from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Console and executed. When downloaded from the console, the installer will have a name that follows the below convention, where `\<VERSION_INFO\>` is replaced with the agent version and `\<ENDPOINT_PROTECTOR_SERVER_ADDRESS\>` is replaced with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server IP or URL:

`EPPClientSetup.<VERSION_INFO>._x86_64_[a=<ENDPOINT_PROTECTOR_SERVER_ADDRESS>].msi`

Example installer:

`EPPClientSetup.6.2.2.1006_x86_64_[a=10.0.0.86].msi`

Note: This does not apply to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Hotfix, as agents were not included in the server patch. To download the agents, please go to the security advisory located at https://security.netwrix.com/Advisories/ADV-2024-002 and download the required agent(s).

## Silent Installation

You can install the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Windows agent silently by using `msiexec` and specifying the options required for your environment.

## Examples

In all the below examples, replace `EPPClient.msi` with the name of the MSI being used.

### Basic Installation

To install the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Agent with the defaults and the EPP server located at `192.168.1.50`, use the following:

```batch
msiexec /i "C:\EPPClient.msi" /qn WSIP=192.168.1.50
```

### Installation with Non-Default Department

Use the same as the basic installation and specify your department code using the `DEPT_CODE` property:

```batch
msiexec /i "C:\EPPClient.msi" /qn WSIP=192.168.1.50 DEPT_CODE=depfin
```

### Installation with Agent-Specific Proxy Settings

To install the agent with a proxy that doesn’t require authentication, use the `PROXYSETTINGSRBGPROP`, `PROXYIP`, and `PROXYPORT` options along with the basic installation. The following will set the agent's proxy to `10.0.0.10:8080`:

```batch
msiexec /i "C:\EPPClient.msi" WSIP=192.168.1.50 PROXYSETTINGSRBGPROP=ManualProxy PROXYIP=10.0.0.10 PROXYPORT=8080
```

Advanced Installations customers requiring further options should see the Appendix for the full list of properties that can be specified.

## Deploying the Agent via Group Policy

Deploying the agent via Group Policy requires editing the MSI either directly or via an MSI transform file to be created and the specific properties updated in the transform. To do this, follow the instructions below:

1. Download the Orca MSI (or your preferred MSI editing software; these instructions use Orca).
   1. Orca can be installed from the Windows SDK and selecting the MSI options.

   9. In the new window, select the **Modifications** tab.
   10. Click **Add** and browse to your saved transform file on the network share.
