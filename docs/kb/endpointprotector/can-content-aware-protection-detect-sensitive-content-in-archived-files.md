# Can Content Aware Protection Detect Sensitive Content in Archived Files?

## Question
Will Netwrix Endpoint Protector's Content Aware Protection detect and block documents containing sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or Social Security numbers, when they are transferred as archives?

## Answer
Netwrix Endpoint Protector's Content Aware agent will detect and block documents with sensitive content only if the archives are not password protected. If an archive is password protected, the agent cannot scan its contents.

> **NOTE:** To help prevent leaks of sensitive data through archives, use the file type filter and select all archive types.
