## Overview

This article explains how to locate logs in the **Content Aware Report** when partitions are used. When you filter by specific dates, you may not see any results if the logs are stored on a different partition.

## Instructions

2. Select the partition that corresponds to the time interval you are searching for to view the relevant logs.
