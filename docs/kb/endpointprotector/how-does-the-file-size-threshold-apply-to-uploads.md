# How Does the File Size Threshold Apply to Uploads?

## Question
How does the File Size Threshold apply to uploads?

## Answer
The **File Size Threshold** setting limits uploads at the individual file level, not at the aggregate level. This approach provides more granular control when multiple files are uploaded through web-facing applications.

To activate this option, do the following:
1. Go to **Content Aware Protection** > **Content Aware Policies**.
2. Select your CAP policy and enable the **File Size Threshold** option.

> **NOTE:** If a File Size Threshold is set, it applies to the entire policy, regardless of which file types or custom contents are selected. The value must be a positive, whole number. For example, if the File Size Threshold is set to `1024 MB`, any file smaller than `1 GB` can be uploaded. If ten `200 MB` files are uploaded, all will be accepted. However, if one of the ten files is `1.5 GB`, the upload attempt will be blocked.
