# Install GlobalSign and DigiCert Root Certificates on Windows

## Overview

This article explains how to install GlobalSign and DigiCert root certificates on Windows. These certificates may be required if you encounter digital signature errors when installing the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Client. The following error messages may populate:

- "A digitally signed driver is required"
- "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting"

Installing the correct root certificates ensures that Windows recognizes the digital signatures used by Netwrix Endpoint Protector components.

## Instructions

1. To verify if the required GlobalSign root certificate is present, navigate to `Program Files\Cososys\EPPNotifier.exe`.
2. Right-click **EPPNotifier.exe** and select **Properties**.
3. Navigate to the **Digital Signatures** tab and select the certificate then click **Details**.
