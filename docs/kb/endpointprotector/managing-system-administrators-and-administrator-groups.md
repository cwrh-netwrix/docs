# Managing System Administrators and Administrator Groups

## Overview

This article explains how to view, create, and manage system administrators and administrator groups in Netwrix Endpoint Protector. You can assign administrators different roles and permissions to control access to various modules and features.

## Instructions

### View or Manage Administrators

1. In the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Console, navigate to **System Configuration** > **System Administrators**.

2. To create a new administrator, click **Create** and provide the following details:
   - Username and password
   - Email address
   - First and last name
   - Phone number
   - UI language
3. Configure account settings as needed:
   - **Account is active:** Enable or disable the account.
   - **Login Attempt Restrictions:** Set a timeout (5–10 minutes) after 5–10 unsuccessful login attempts.
   - **Enforce login IP restrictions:** Restrict login attempts to specific IP addresses.
   - **Require password change at next login:** Force the administrator to change their password at first login.

> **CAUTION:** The **Require password change at next login** setting is ignored if **Enforce All Administrator Password Security at Next Login** is enabled for Active Directory imported users or for SSO users (Azure and OKTA).

4. Optional: Enable additional settings as needed:
   - **Failed Login Alert:** Receive alerts for failed login attempts.
   - **Schedule Exports Alert:** Receive alerts for scheduled exports.
   - **Ignore AD Authentication:** Allow login using local EPP credentials.
5. To assign Super Administrator privileges, enable **Super Administrator**. This grants access to all departments and Netwrix Endpoint Protector sections.

7. Assign the administrator to one or more departments or administrator groups as needed.
