# Can Endpoint Protector Block Internal Card Readers on Mac?

## Question
Is it possible to block an internal card reader on Mac with Endpoint Protector?

## Answer
Yes, Endpoint Protector can block internal card readers on Mac computers. In the Endpoint Protector interface, a card reader is recognized as a **USB Storage Device**.

If the rights for the **USB Storage Device** class are set to **Allow**, internal card readers will also be allowed, and users will be able to access information from inserted cards.

If the rights for the **USB Storage Device** class are set to **Deny**, the internal card reader will be blocked.
