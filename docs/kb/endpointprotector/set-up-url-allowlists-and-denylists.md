# Set Up URL Allowlists and Denylists

## Question
Is it possible to set up URL allowlists and denylists?

## Answer
Yes, this is possible. To set up URL allowlists and denylists, ensure that Deep Packet Inspection is enabled in **Device Control > Global Settings**.

### Setting Up a URL Denylist
The URL denylist is used to block access to specific websites.

1. In the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Console, navigate to **Denylists and Allowlists > Denylists > Domain and URL**.
2. Click **Add** to create a list of URLs to block. Set a name and description for the list, add the URLs, and click **Save**.

> **NOTE:** You can use `*` as a wildcard to match anything before or after the domain. For example, `*example*` will block access to any website with "example" in the URL."

### Apply Denylist to Users/Computers
1. In the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Console, navigate to **Content Aware Protection > Content Aware Policies** and edit the policy.
2. Ensure that the web browsers used by users are included in the **Policy Exit Points**.
3. Scroll to the policy denylists, click the **Domain and URL** tab, select the checkbox next to the denylist you want to use, and click **Save**.

1. In the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Console, navigate to **Denylists and Allowlists > Allowlist > Deep Packet Inspection**.
2. Click **Add** to create a list of URLs to allow uploads. Set a name and description for the list, add the URLs, and click **Save**.

> **NOTE:** You can use `*` as a wildcard to match anything before or after the domain. For example, `*example*` will block access to any website with "example" in the URL.
