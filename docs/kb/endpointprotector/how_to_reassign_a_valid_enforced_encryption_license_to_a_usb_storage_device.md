## Overview

This article provides step-by-step instructions on how to reassign a valid Enforced Encryption (EasyLock) license from the server to a USB storage device.

Follow these steps to reassign a valid license to a USB storage device:

1. To configure the USB device, navigate to **Device Control > Devices** in Endpoint Protector.

6. Extract **EasyLock_util.exe** to the root of the USB storage device and run it.
7. Download the EasyLock package from the server and copy it to the root of the USB storage device. Extract all files and overwrite existing files.
8. Open **EasyLock.exe** from the USB storage device and enter the password.
