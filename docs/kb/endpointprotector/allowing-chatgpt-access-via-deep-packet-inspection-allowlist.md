# Allowing ChatGPT Access via Deep Packet Inspection Allowlist

## Overview

This article explains how to configure Endpoint Protector to allow access to ChatGPT by adding the `openai.com` domain to a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) allowlist. In environments where DPI is enabled, web-based AI services like ChatGPT may be blocked by default because security policies restrict access to certain domains.

## Instructions

1. In the Endpoint Protector Console, navigate to **Denylists and Allowlists** > **Allowlists** > **Deep Packet Inspection**.
2. Create a new allowlist dictionary for allowed domains and add the domain using wildcards:
   `*openai.com*`
3. Once the allowlist dictionary is created, include it in the relevant Content Aware Policy.
4. Edit the Content Aware Policy.
5. Expand the **Policy Allowlist** section.
6. Navigate to **Deep Packet Inspection** and select the dictionary you created.
7. Save the policy.
