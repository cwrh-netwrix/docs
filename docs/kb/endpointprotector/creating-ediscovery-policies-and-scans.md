2. Choose the OS type, provide a policy name, select items of focus and click **Save**.

3. After agents are deployed, a section for defined scans will appear under **Policies and Scans**.

4. Select a defined scan to configure scanning options:
   - Choose **Manual Scanning** or **Automatic Scanning**. If **Automatic Scanning** is selected, configure the scan interval in the window that appears.
   - Select either a **clean scan** for a full assessment or an **incremental scan** which is recommended after an initial clean scan.

5. When scan results are available, choose the **Action** to **Inspect found items** or navigate to the **Scan Results and Actions** section within the eDiscovery expansion tree in the Management Console.
