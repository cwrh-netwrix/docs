# Missing Devices in the Client List

## Overview

This article outlines the steps to diagnose and resolve issues where devices do not appear in the client list for Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Instructions

1. Open Certificate Manager in Windows 10 by running `certmgr.msc` from the command prompt.
2. Under **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** > **Certificates**, check if GlobalSign certificates are present and take a screenshot.
3. If there is more than one GlobalSign certificate, right-click each one then **Properties**, and take a screenshot of the properties window.
4. Right-click the installer on the affected machine, select **Properties** then go to the **Digital Signatures** tab (if available), and take a screenshot.
