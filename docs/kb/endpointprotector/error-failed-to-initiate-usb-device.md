# Error: Failed to Initiate USB device

## Question
Why does the error message "Failed to initiate USB device" appear when attempting to start EasyLock from **Finder** with read-only access enforced on macOS?

## Answer
You see this error on macOS when the **Allow Access if TD1+, otherwise Read Only** right is applied. Due to operating system limitations, you cannot launch applications from a device when read-only access is enforced. As a result, when you start EasyLock from **Finder**, you see the "Failed to initiate USB device" error.

To launch EasyLock, use the **Netwrix Endpoint Protector Client** or **Notifier** and click the **mini USB icon**. This method allows Netwrix Endpoint Protector to grant the necessary access for EasyLock to run on the USB device.
