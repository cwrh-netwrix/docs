### Use Case

Via Netwrix Privilege Secure UI or DirectConnect, the helpdesk admin selects the Remote Assistance Activity and chooses the resource to which remote assistance is to be provided.

When the Activity has been provisioned, the session is launched, and the target users’ desktop displays a message asking permission for the helpdesk admin to connect.

The helpdesk admin can now view the target users’ desktop and can establish a chat session.

If the helpdesk admin needs to take control of the remote system, they select **Request Control** and the end user is prompted for permission.

Once shared, control can be terminated at any time by the helpdesk admin or the end user.
