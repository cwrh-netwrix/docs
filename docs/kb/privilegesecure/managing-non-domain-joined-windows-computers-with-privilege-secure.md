- PowerShell Remoting enabled on the target computer (`Enable-PSRemoting` ⸱ Microsoft) (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/enable-psremoting?view=powershell-7.2)
- Port 5985 open for connections from the Netwrix Privilege Secure server (and any hosts running remote action services, if applicable)

## Instructions

### Adding the Netwrix Privilege Secure Service Account

1. As a user with the Administrator role, open Netwrix Privilege Secure. Navigate to the **Configuration > Service Accounts** page.
2. Click the green plus button to create a new Service Account
3. Enter the required information
   1. Name (a friendly name that is displayed in the rest of the UI for this account)
   2. Description (additional text for identifying this account)
   3. Domain (This MUST be the `NETBIOS` name of the target computer)

### Additional Troubleshooting: "Access Denied""

In the event that you see "Access Denied" when investigating the logs, refer to Netwrix Privilege Secure: Resolving "Access Denied" When Connecting to a Non-domain-joined Windows Resource (https://kb.netwrix.com/8526).

## Summary

After going through this process, you can use this computer's resource in Activities. A non-domain joined Windows computer can be used in any activity that doesn’t require Active Directory. You can create local Activity Token users and local managed accounts. Requester and accounts that require Active Directory will not work.

To configure a local Activity Token/Managed Account activity, when creating the activity remove the “%targetdomain%\” portion of the default Login Account Format. Make sure to use the **Windows** Platform as well.
