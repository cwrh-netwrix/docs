# Troubleshooting a "User Id Mismatch" Error During Login

## Summary

When logging into the Netwrix Privilege Secure console, you may receive a "User Id Mismatch" response that prevents login. This is caused when there is a mismatch between a Netwrix Privilege Secure user stored in a cookie, and the user attempting login. Generally this is caused when multiple sessions are being launched from the same browser using different users.
