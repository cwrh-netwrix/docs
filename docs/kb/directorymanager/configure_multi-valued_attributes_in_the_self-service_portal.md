# Configure Multi-Valued Attributes in the Self-Service Portal

## Applies To

Directory Manager 11

## Overview

This article explains how to configure the Self-Service portal in Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) to support multi-valued attributes, using `carLicense` as an example.

Multi-valued attributes in Active Directory, such as `carLicense` or phone numbers, allow users to store multiple unique values in a single field. In contrast, single-valued attributes, such as names, can hold only one value. Active Directory does not create attributes with empty values, and each value in a multi-valued attribute must be unique.

## Instructions

1. In the Directory Manager Admin Center, go to **Applications**. On the application or portal where you want to add the attribute, click the three-dot icon and select **Settings**.
