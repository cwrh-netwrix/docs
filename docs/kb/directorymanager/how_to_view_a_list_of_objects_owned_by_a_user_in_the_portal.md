# How to View a List of Objects Owned by a User in the Portal

## Overview

Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) allows you to view all groups owned by a specific user in the portal. By adding a new field mapped to the **managedObjects** attribute in the user properties, you can display a list of groups that a user owns. This article explains how to configure the portal to show this information.

> **NOTE:** Before making any changes to your environment, it is highly recommended to create a backup, snapshot, or checkpoint of the Directory Manager server.

The default properties page for users does not display owned groups:

## Instructions

### Add the Owned Objects Field to User Properties

1. In the **Directory Manager Admin Center**, go to the **Applications** tab in the left navigation bar.
2. Click the three-dot icon for the portal you want to modify, then click **Settings**.
