# Allow Unauthenticated Users to Send Email to a Distribution List

## Overview

By default, Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) and Active Directory require that only authenticated users can send email to a distribution group. However, you can allow unauthenticated users to send email by exposing the **msExchRequireAuthToSendTo** attribute as a checkbox in the New Group wizard or group properties in the User portal. Clearing this checkbox allows unauthenticated users to send email to the group.

## Instructions

### Expose the msExchRequireAuthToSendTo Attribute in the User Portal

1. In the Admin Center, select **Applications**.
2. Under **Directory Manager Portal**, click the three-dot icon for your portal and select **Settings**.
