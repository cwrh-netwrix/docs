# Update Support Email Address for Contact Link

## Applies To
Netwrix Directory Manager 11

## Overview
The Netwrix Directory Manager application portal includes a **Contact** link at the bottom of each page. This link opens your default email application with a pre-filled support email address, allowing users to contact the admin or helpdesk for inquiries, support requests, or feedback. You may need to change this email address so users can contact your local IT team for portal-related issues.
