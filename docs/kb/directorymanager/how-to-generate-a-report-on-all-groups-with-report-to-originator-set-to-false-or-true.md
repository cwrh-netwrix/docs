# How to Generate a Report on All Groups with Report to Originator Set to False or True

## Applies To
Netwrix Directory Manager â€“ [Reports â¸± Imanami ðŸ–½](https://www.imanami.com/reports/)

## Overview
Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) allows you to generate reports on all groups with the **Report To Originator** attribute set to either **false** or **true**. The `reportToOriginator` parameter determines whether a delivery report is sent to the user (originator) who sends an email to a distribution group. This article explains how to generate these reports using the **Reports** module. The **Reports** module is a free tool for running reports on Active Directory and Microsoft Exchange/Office 365.

> **NOTE:** The values of `reportToManager` and `reportToOriginator` cannot both be set to `$true` at the same time. If one is set to `$true`, the other must be set to `$false`; otherwise, all delivery status messages will be suppressed.

## Instructions

1. Open the Netwrix Directory Manager Portal and go to the **Reports** options.
