# How to Delegate Password Reset Privileges in Self-Service Portal

3. Select **Design Settings** and then select **Identity Store**.
4. Click the **Navigation bar** tab.

7. From the **Access Level** list on the **Edit Link** dialog box, select a security role. This role and any roles with a higher priority value can reset the passwords of other users through the Self-Service portal.
8. Click **OK** to close the dialog boxes and then save the changes.

## Impact on the Self-Service Portal
In the Self-Service portal, the **Reset Password** node will be visible to the selected role and to roles with a higher priority value.
