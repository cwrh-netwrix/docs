# How to Limit Users to Search Only for User Objects

## Overview

This article explains how to configure Netwrix Directory Manager so that users can search only for User objects in the User portal's **Find** dialog box.

By default, the **Find** dialog box allows users to search for all object types, including users, contacts, and groups. You can restrict this feature to specific object types by adjusting the portal settings.

## Instructions

1. In the **Directory Manager Admin Center**, go to **Applications**. Locate the desired application/portal and click the three-dot icon to select **Settings**.

2. Click **Advanced Settings**. Under the **Portal & Search** tab on the right, locate the **Find Dialogue / Look For** option. Uncheck **Groups** and **Contacts** to limit searches to User objects only.
