# View and Manage Your Group Memberships

## Applies To

Netwrix Directory Manager 11

## Overview

End users typically do not have direct access to directory services, such as Active Directory, to review their group memberships. Netwrix Directory Manager provides a portal that allows users to view all directory groups—including distribution lists and security groups—of which they are members. Through the portal, users can review group properties, determine their current access, and manage their memberships according to their assigned permissions.

## Instructions

### View and Manage Your Group Memberships

1. Log in to the Netwrix Directory Manager portal.
2. In the left pane, click **Groups > My Groups** then select the **My Memberships** tab.

3. This page lists all groups that the logged-in user is a member of. Click the display name of a group to view its properties.
4. The actions you can perform for a group depend on your rights and privileges in Netwrix Directory Manager. For example, your rights determine whether you can edit group properties or leave the group.
