# Gather Debug Logs for v11

## Applies To
Netwrix Directory Manager 11

## Overview
By default, Netwrix Directory Manager application logs are set to **Error** mode for logging. To capture detailed logs, you must manually set each application to **Debug** mode before collecting the logs.

Netwrix Directory Manager logging levels are configured per application, so you must enable Debug mode for each relevant component individually.

This article covers the steps to:
- Dump log files to a specific location from the Admin Center portal
- Enable Debug mode for individual applications including:
  - Admin Center
  - Data Service
  - Security Service
  - Application Portal
  - Email Service
  - Scheduler Service
  - Configuration Tool
  - Elasticsearch
