# Add Active Directory Attribute to Replication Sche

## Applies To

Netwrix Directory Manager 11

## Overview

Add new or custom Active Directory (AD) attributes to the Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) replication schema so they are included in replication to the Elasticsearch repository.

## Instructions

### When to Add a New Attribute

- You have defined a new custom attribute in AD and want to use it with Netwrix Directory Manager.
- An attribute does not appear in the Smart Group criteria, roles, or filters.

### Steps to Add a New AD Attribute to the Replication Schema

1. Identify the custom or existing AD attribute that is missing from roles, filters, or Smart Group criteria in Netwrix Directory Manager.
2. Log in to the Netwrix Directory Manager Admin Centre.
3. In the navigation pane, select the **Identity Stores** tab. Click the three-dot icon next to the required identity store, and select **Edit**.
