# Unable to Sort Groups by DisplayName

## Applies To
Netwrix Directory Manager 11

## Symptom
When you attempt to sort the **My Groups** listing in Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) by the **Display Name** attribute, the groups do not sort in ascending (alphabetical) order as expected. The screen may display a “Loading” message, but the system fails to sort the listing.

## Causes
- The **Display Name** attribute is not mandatory for groups created directly in Active Directory, so some groups may not have this attribute populated.
- When you sort by **Display Name** in Netwrix Directory Manager, the portal treats missing display names as null values and uses the **Common Name** instead. This can result in incorrect or failed sorting.
- Groups created using Netwrix Directory Manager always have a **Display Name** because it is a required attribute.

## Resolutions
1. Verify which groups are missing the **Display Name** attribute by checking the attribute editor in Active Directory.
2. Populate the **Display Name** attribute for all groups that are missing it.
3. After all groups have a **Display Name**, the Netwrix Directory Manager portal will sort group listings correctly by this attribute.

> **NOTE:** You may use bulk editing tools or scripts to update the **Display Name** attribute for multiple groups in Active Directory if needed.
