# How to View Roles Assigned to a User v10

## Applies To
Netwrix Directory Manager 10

## Overview
Netwrix Directory Manager allows you to assign security roles to users in an identity store, controlling their access and permissions. Knowing which roles are assigned to each user is important for effective access management and security.

This article explains how to quickly view a user's assigned security roles in an identity store for any Netwrix Directory Manager client.

### Directory Manager Clients
You can check a user's security role assignment for the following Netwrix Directory Manager clients:

- Automate
- Management Shell
- Netwrix Directory Manager Mobile app
- All Self-Service and Password Centre portals created using Netwrix Directory Manager

## Instructions
1. In the Netwrix Directory Manager Management Console, click the **Identity Stores** node.
2. On the **Identity Stores** tab, double-click an identity store to open its properties.
3. On the **Security Roles** tab, click **Get Security Roles** to view the roles assigned to a user in the selected Netwrix Directory Manager client.
