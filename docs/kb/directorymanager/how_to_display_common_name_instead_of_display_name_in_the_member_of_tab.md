# How to Display Common Name Instead of Display Name in the Member Of Tab

## Applies To

Directory Manager 11

## Overview

In the Directory Manager portal, the **Member Of** tab shows the **Display Name** of the groups a user is a member of. This can cause sorting issues if some groups do not have the **DisplayName** attribute populated. You can resolve this issue by displaying the **Common Name (CN)** instead of **DisplayName** in the **Member Of** tab.

> **NOTE:** Before making any changes to your environment, create a backup, snapshot, or checkpoint of the Directory Manager server.

## Instructions

1. In **Directory Manager Admin Center**, go to **Application** from the navigation bar and click the three-dot icon for the portal you want to customize.
2. Click the **Settings** button. A new page will appear.
3. Select the **Identity Store** you want to customize the design for.
4. Navigate to **Custom Display Types** and look for **userMembersOfGrid**.
