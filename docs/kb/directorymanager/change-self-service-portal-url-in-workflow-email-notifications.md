# Change Self-Service Portal URL in Workflow Email Notifications

## Applies To

Netwrix Directory Manager 11

## Overview

If you change the hostname for the Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) Self-Service portal, workflow email notifications may still include the old portal URL. Update the portal URL in each workflow to ensure notifications direct users to the correct address.

## Instructions

### Change the Self-Service Portal URL in Workflow Email Notifications

1. In the Netwrix Directory Manager Admin portal, click the **Identity Stores** tab.
2. On the **Identity Stores** tab, click the three-dot icon next to the relevant identity store and select **Edit**.
3. Click the **Workflows** tab. Select the workflow for which you want to change the portal URL and click **Edit**.  
   To change the URL in email notifications that alert group owners to approve or deny membership requests, select **Workflow to Join a Group**.
