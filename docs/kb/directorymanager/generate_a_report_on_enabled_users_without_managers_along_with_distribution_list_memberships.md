## Overview

6. On the first page, provide a name for the report then choose the search scope within the directory and provide a filter criterion. By default, the wizard searches the Global Catalog. To limit the scope to a particular container:
   1. Click **Browse** to launch the **Select Container** dialog box and select the required source container.
   2. Select the **Include sub-containers** check box to include sub-containers in the report.
   3. In the **Filter Criteria** box, modify the default LDAP filter. The default filter generates a list of all users in the domain along with their group memberships.
   4. Add the filter **manager Not Present** to fetch a list of all enabled users without managers, along with DL memberships.
