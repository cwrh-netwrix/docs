# Generate a Report on Groups Without Members or Owners

## Applies To

## Overview

Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) allows you to generate reports on groups that have no members and no owners or additional owners.

## Instructions

### Generate a Report on Groups Without Members or Owners

6. The report creation wizard prompts you to enter a name for the report. Choose the search scope within the directory and provide a filter criterion. By default, the wizard searches the Global Catalog. To limit the scope to a particular container:
   1. Click **Browse** to launch the **Select Container** dialog box and select the required source container.
   2. Select the **Include sub-containers** check box to include sub-containers in the report.
   3. In the **Filter Criteria** box, modify the default LDAP filter. The default filter generates a list of all groups in the domain.
   4. Add new clauses, **XAdditionalOwner Not Present** and **member Not Present**, to fetch a list of all groups without members and without owners or additional owners.

8. The **Report Fields** page displays the fields that will be included in the report. To add more fields, click **Add**. To remove a field, select it and click the **X**. You can change the order of fields using the two lined icon.
