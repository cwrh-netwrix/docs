# How to Add Attributes to the Export List in the Application Portal

## Overview

This article explains how to add additional attributes to the list of exportable fields in the Export option of the Application portal in **Netwrix Directory Manager** (formerly GroupID). By default, only a standard set of attributes is available for export. You can customize this list to include other attributes, such as **Common Name (CN)**.

To add more attributes to the Export list, you must update the portal's design settings.
