# Restrict Users from Accessing the Admin Portal

## Question
Is it possible to restrict end users from accessing the Netwrix Directory Manager Admin Portal/Center?

## Answer
Yes, you can limit access to the Admin Portal/Center. To prevent end users from accessing the Admin Center and reduce the risk of unauthorized access, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to the **Netwrix Directory Manager Admin Center** and navigate to the **Identity Store** tab.
2. Open the settings for the Identity Store and go to the **Security Roles** section.
3. Edit the security role for which you want to restrict access.
4. Click the **Add Criteria** button then the **Show Advanced** button to display advanced filtering options.
5. Click **Add Criteria** again and configure the following:

| Field       | Condition | Value |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Client Name | is not    | `Admin Center` |

6. Click **Save** 3 times to apply your changes.

After completing these steps, users assigned to that security role will no longer be able to access the Admin Center.
