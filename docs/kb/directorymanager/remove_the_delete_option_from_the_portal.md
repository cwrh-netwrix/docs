# Remove the Delete Option from the Portal

## Applies To

Directory Manager 11

## Overview

Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID) allows you to control which users can delete groups in the portal. To prevent accidental deletion of critical groups, you can restrict the Delete option so that only administrators have permission to delete groups. This article explains how to remove or hide the Delete option from the portal for non-administrative users.

## Instructions

### Restrict the Delete Option in the Directory Manager Portal

1. In the **Directory Manager Admin Center**, go to the **Applications** tab in the left navigation bar.
2. Click the three-dot icon for the portal you want to modify, then click **Settings**.

6. In the new window, locate the **Visibility Role** drop-down list and change the value from **Users** to **Administrator**. When **Users** is selected, the button is visible to all roles with a higher priority than Users. To hide the Delete button from everyone, select **Never**.

To hide the Delete option from the **Group Search** or **My Groups** toolbars, select the **Groups Search** toolbar type in step 4 and repeat steps 5 to 7.
