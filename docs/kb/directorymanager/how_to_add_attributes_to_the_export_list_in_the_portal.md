# How to Add Attributes to the Export List in the Portal

## Overview

This article explains how to add additional attributes to the list of exportable fields in the Export option of the **Netwrix Directory Manager** (formerly **GroupID**) Portal. By default, only a standard set of attributes is available for export. You can customize the portal design to include other attributes, such as **Common Name (CN)**, in the export list.

> **NOTE:** Before making any changes to your environment, create a backup, snapshot, or checkpoint of the Directory Manager server.
