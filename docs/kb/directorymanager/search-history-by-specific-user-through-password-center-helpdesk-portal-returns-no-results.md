# Search History by Specific User Through Password C  No Results

## Symptom

This article addresses the issue you encounter when you attempt to search for the history of a specific user through the Netwrix Password Reset Helpdesk Portal. The **History** feature of the portal enables Helpdesk users to audit and analyze the functions performed by end users.

In the **History** section of the Netwrix Password Reset Helpdesk Portal, when you search for the history of any individual user, no records are displayed.

## Cause

The default setting for the **Performed By** field is `Any` instead of `End User`.

## Resolution

1. Select `End User` in the **Performed By** field.
2. Search for the user by typing their display name in the **User Name** field.
