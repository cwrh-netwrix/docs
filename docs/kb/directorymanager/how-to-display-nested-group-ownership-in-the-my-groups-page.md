# How to Display Nested Group Ownership in the My Groups Page

## Applies To
Netwrix Directory Manager 11

## Overview
This article explains how to display nested (transitive) group ownership on the **My Groups** page in Netwrix Directory Manager 11. By default, nested ownership is not shown in the Self-Service Portal, but you can enable this feature using an advanced setting.

Some groups in Active Directory are owned by a security group. You may want members of the owner group to see their owned groups on the **My Groups** page. For example, if User A is a member of Group A, and Group A is the owner of Group B, then User A is considered the owner of Group B through nested (transitive) ownership.

## Instructions
1. In the Directory Manager Admin Center, select **Applications**. Under **Directory Manager Portal**, select the **three dots** button for your portal, then click **Settings**.
