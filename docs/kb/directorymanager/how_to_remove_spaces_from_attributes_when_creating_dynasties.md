# How to Remove Spaces from Attributes When Creating Dynasties

## Applies To

Directory Manager 11

## Overview

You can remove spaces (or other special characters) from group names when creating dynasties in **Netwrix Directory Manager** (formerly GroupID) by using a custom script for the relevant attribute (such as **Department**). This ensures that leaf dynasty names do not include spaces from the source attribute.

> **NOTE:** Before making any changes to your environment, create a backup, snapshot, or checkpoint of the Directory Manager server.

## Instructions

1. Log in to the **Directory Manager Portal** and navigate to the **Parent Dynasty Properties** for which you want to make the changes.
2. Once the Parent Dynasty properties are open, click the **Dynasty Options** tab.
3. In the **Attributes** field, select the attribute for which you want to omit the spaces.
4. Click the **Edit** button. A new window will appear.
