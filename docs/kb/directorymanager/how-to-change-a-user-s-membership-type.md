# How to Change a User's Membership Type

## Overview

This article explains how to change a user's membership type in Netwrix Directory Manager, including how to assign temporary membership with automatic removal after a specified period.

Netwrix Directory Manager allows you to add users to Active Directory groups as temporary members and specify start and end dates for their membership. The Membership Life Cycle job runs in the background to add or remove temporary group members on the specified dates. This enables scenarios such as granting external users access for a limited time without affecting permanent group members.

## Membership Types

| Membership Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Perpetual | The object is a permanent member of the group. |
| Temporary Member | The object is a member of the group for the period specified in the **Beginning** and **Ending** fields. At the end of the period, the object is removed from group membership. |
| Addition Pending | The object will become a temporary member of the group for a future period. Use the **Beginning** and **Ending** fields to set the period. Before the beginning date, the membership type is displayed as "Addition Pending." On the beginning date, the membership type changes to "Temporary Member."  **Example:** If you add Smith as a temporary member to Group A for May 20–30, Smith appears as "Addition Pending" until May 20. On May 20, Smith becomes a "Temporary Member." After May 30, Smith is removed from the group. |
| Removal Pending | The object will be temporarily removed from group membership for a future period. Use the **Beginning** and **Ending** fields to set the period. Before the beginning date, the membership type is "Removal Pending." On the beginning date, the membership type changes to "Temporary Removed."  **Example:** If you remove Smith from Group A for May 20–30, Smith appears as "Removal Pending" until May 20. On May 20, Smith's membership type changes to "Temporary Removed." After May 30, Smith is added back as a permanent member. |
| Temporary Removed | The object is temporarily removed from group membership for the specified period. At the end of the period, the object is added back as a permanent member. |

## Instructions
