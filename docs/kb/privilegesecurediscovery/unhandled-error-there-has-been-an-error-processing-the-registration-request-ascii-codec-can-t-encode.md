# Unhandled Error: there has been an Error Processing the Registration Request: ''ascii'' Codec can''t Encode Character u

Formerly SecureONE

## Symptom

Example of error when running registration via Postman:

```json
{
    "name": "UnprocessableEntityError",
    "message":"Unhandled error: ('There has been an error processing the registration request:', \"'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\\â€“' in position 28: ordinal not in range(128)\")",
    "code": 1779
}
```

## Cause

There is a unicode character in the sudoers file that Netwrix Privilege Secure Discovery has an issue with. In the above example it was a En Dash (long dash), or unicode character U+2013, in a sudo command instead of a standard dash.

## Resolution

The solution is to replace any En Dashes with standard dashes in the sudoers file using:

```bash
sudo visudo
```
