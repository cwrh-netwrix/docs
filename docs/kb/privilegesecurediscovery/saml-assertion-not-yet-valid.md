# SAML Assertion not yet Valid

Formerly SecureONE

## Symptom

When attempting to log in to Netwrix Privilege Secure Discovery UI using Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) as the identity provider, you receive the following error:

```
SAML assertion not yet valid
```

## Resolution

In ADFS add the `NotBeforeSkew` value to the relying party on the ADFS server. The number after `NotBeforeSkew` represent the number of minutes to skew the `NotBeforeValue`, so a setting of 3 would result in a `NotBefore` of -3 minutes.

This is the PowerShell command to set `NotBeforeSkew`:

```powershell
Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -TargetIdentifier "" -NotBeforeSkew 3"
```
