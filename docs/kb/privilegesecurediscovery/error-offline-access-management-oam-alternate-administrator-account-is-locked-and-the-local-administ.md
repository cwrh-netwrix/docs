# Error: Offline Access Management (OAM) Alternate Administrator Account is Locked and the Local Administrator (RID 500) Account is Disabled

## Symptom

Error message:

```text
Offline Access Management (OAM) alternate administrator account is locked and the local Administrator (RID 500) account is disabled
```

The system has either left the domain or lost trust.

## Cause

The alternate administrator OAM account is a local account. Netwrix Privilege Secure Discovery does not use the account to log into the system and does not have the ability to lock the OAM account. Typically, any local account is either locked by an Administrator or exceeded the threshold for failed login attempts.

## Resolution

Use Windows Safe Mode to log in with the disabled Administrator (RID 500) account.
