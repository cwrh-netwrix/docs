# How Netwrix Privilege Secure for Discovery Determines a Host is Offline

Formerly SecureONE

## Overview

When you reach out to systems for any action, Netwrix Privilege Secure for Discovery will use the `FQDN` (fully-qualified domain name) or the last known IP address. The `CN` (common name, short name) is never used.

## How the scanner and worker services determine offline hosts

The Netwrix Privilege Secure for Discovery scanner and worker services will:

1. Attempt to ping (`IPv4`), then connect using the `FQDN` first, if that fails. Timeout for ping, using `fping`, is `500ms`.
2. Attempt to ping, then connect using the last known IP address.
3. Retry both `FQDN` and the last known IP address one more time.
4. If both ping retries fail, the host is deemed offline and the `Host Offline` error occurs.
