# Error: 9999 Mismatch in Service Account Username when Attempting to Rotate Service Password

## Symptom

When attempting to scan an endpoint the following error occurs:

```
9999 Mismatch in service account username when attempting to rotate service password
```

The scan will not complete.

## Cause

It is a bug related to the **Local Admin Password TTL Days**. This is an older feature that supported rotating local account passwords which is no longer supported/leveraged. We have set this to 0 in all installations/upgrades moving forward.

## Resolution

1. Update the **Local Admin Password TTL Days** to `0` for the respective service
2. Restart the service via the UI
