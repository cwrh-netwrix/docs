# Password Never Expires Report Shows Incorrect Data

## Symptom

In Netwrix 1Secure, the **Password never expires** setting is incorrectly reported as enabled for particular accounts. When you review **Active Directory Users and Computers** settings, the setting is disabled for affected accounts.

## Cause

A GPO with the `maxPasswordAge=0` parameter is applied to the affected accounts. The parameter causes Netwrix OneSecutre to report the **Password never expires** setting as enabled.

## Resolution

In the corresponding GPO, set the `maxPasswordAge` parameter to any non-zero value. This will allow Netwrix OneSecutre to correctly report the affected accounts.
