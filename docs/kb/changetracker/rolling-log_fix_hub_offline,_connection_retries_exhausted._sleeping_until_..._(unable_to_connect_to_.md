## What Does It Mean?

This error occurs when your agent cannot reach the Netwrix Server. There are many things that can cause this issue, including but not limited to:

1. Your Netwrix Server may actually be powered off, **IIS** is not running, or **MongoDB** is not running.
2. Your Netwrix Server may not be on the domain, does not have a network connection, or is in the wrong subnet.
3. The port the agent is using is currently being used by another application, causing a clash.
4. Your firewall is not allowing connection to the Netwrix Server over the specified port.
5. Your routes are not configured to allow communication between the Netwrix Server and the Agent.
6. If you configured the agent using a Fully Qualified Domain Name instead of an IP Address, the issue could be DNS related.
7. If your agent is on a WAN or a different LAN, you may have to configure port forwarding.
8. If your agent is on a WAN or a different LAN, you may need to modify NAT settings to allow communication.
9. If your agent is on a WAN or a different LAN, you may need to modify proxy settings if you have a Web or other proxy.
10. If your agent is on a Cloud Provider Network, you may need to modify the Cloud Provider's traffic variables to allow communication.

## How Can I Fix This / Should I Worry?

If you are receiving this error, this means the agent is currently not sending any logs to the Netwrix Server! To fix this error, check the above items and verify that everything is functioning properly.

> **IMPORTANT:** In most cases, if it is one of the above items causing the issue, simply resolving that problem will fix the issue. If not, please restart the agent service.
