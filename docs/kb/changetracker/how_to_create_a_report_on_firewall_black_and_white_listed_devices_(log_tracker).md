# How to Create a Report on Firewall Black and White Listed Devices

## Overview

The **Reports > Audit > Perimeter** reporting facility can be configured to generate reports on blacklisted and whitelisted IP addresses. This may be useful to acquire a report on internal or perimeter devices of special interest. You can configure the report view to show internal devices that match a blacklist, external devices that match a blacklist, or both.

## Instructions

To accomplish this:

1. First, create either a blacklist or a whitelist in the **Correlation > Config > Lists** facility. This list will simply be a list of IP addresses of interest, listed one line at a time. The list can be largeâ€”perhaps up to 50,000 different addresses.
2. Then, on the **Reports > Audit > Perimeter** screen, click **Add New** to add a new report viewer. For the **Match External Address** (or the **Match Local Addrs**), simply specify the list macro as the column match qualifier.

See the screenshot below for further assistance:

Finally, note that this same technique may be useful for creating a report of blacklisted or whitelisted country codes. For example, to create a report of message references associated with a long list of country codes, you could create a list macro such as `@@allowed_countries@@` and then use this as the match qualifier for **Country Codes (column 2)**, such as `not @@allowed_countries@@`. (A list of country codes can be found in the **More > Geo-IP Tool** screen.)
