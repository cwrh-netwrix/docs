# Configuration Templates: Local User/Domain Controller Account Tracker (Windows Only)

## Overview

Change Tracker can also be used to track changes to Local User Account Settings. Typically, local User Accounts should be limited and usage restricted in favor of centralized identity and access management authority such as a Domain Controller. As such, the monitoring of local user accounts is a key security consideration.

> **NOTE:** When an NNT Change Tracker Agent is used on a Domain Controller, tracking the local user accounts will, in effect, track the Domain user accounts. In cases where this is not required, uncheck the **Track account information on Domain Controllers** box to limit tracking to just the Built-In accounts only.

## Instructions

There is minimal configuration required to activate the tracker:

1. Check the **Track local user account settings in this template** box.
2. Define the poll period.
3. Save settings to the Template.

Any changes to the initial baseline will be alerted and reported.
