# Differences Between Greenbone Community Feed and the Enterprise Feed

## Overview

There are three main areas of difference between the professional solution and the community edition.

### 1) The Feed

The following list gives some examples of those professional enterprise-grade products which are only part of the professional Greenbone Security Feed:

- Generally, all Enterprise-grade products and all OT (i.e., ICS/SCADA) products
- MS Windows Server and back office solutions (e.g., SharePoint, SQL Server, others)
- Products from Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, Juniper Networks, and Fortinet
- Oracle Solaris IBM WebSphere products (i.e., IBM WebSphere Application Server)
- Lotus Notes or SAP products
- VMware paid products

### 2) Solution Delivery, Deployment, and Support

Probably nothing surprising here; the professional solution gets full, SLA-based support. The community edition does not. There is more related to the appliances, which may not be relevant here.

### 3) Features

The basic features are the same; still, some enterprise-oriented features are not part of the community edition. As examples:

- Feed updates via S-Proxy
- System updates and upgrades included in the feed
- Connectors to other Enterprise products like Palo Alto firewalls, SIEM systems, and similar
- Backup/restore, alarms/schedules
- Master/Slave architecture
