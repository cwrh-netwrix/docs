# Configuration Templates: Working with Baseline Data

> **Note:** Baseline Data functions are only supported with the Netwrix Gen 7 Agent.

Change Tracker Gen 7 has been designed to localize baseline data with the Agent. The key advantage of an Agent for File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is that it can monitor file changes in real-time. Due to the agent being installed on the monitored host, the OS activity can be monitored, and any file activity can be observed and changes recorded.

![Baseline Data Monitoring](https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&ids=0684u00000LdJxF&d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LzPn%2FYpZEAYyR2XxhBi3NkSkve2dEzkExF0iT7cnpwTNiHp0&asPdf=false)

The second major advantage of an agent is that the monitored host does not need to be 'opened up' to allow monitoring. All critical system and configuration files will always be protected by the host filesystem security; for example, the Windows System 32 folder is always an 'Administrator Access Only' folder. An agentless monitoring approach would therefore need to operate using an Admin-level account with network access to the monitored host, while an agent can operate within the confines of the host, just pushing out file integrity changes as they are detected. 

Finally, an agent offers a further advantage over and above the agentless approach in that it can offer a 'changes only' update across the network and will only require host resources when there is a change to assess and report. By contrast, for every polled check, an agentless scan will always need to re-examine and generate new hash values for all files in order to detect any changes, even if there are none. See 'FIM Agent Versus Agentless FIM'.

However, there are cases whereby the baseline data has other useful applications outside of change detection for the individual host, for example:

- To retain a 'hard copy' of a device's configuration settings, such as a router config or firewall ruleset, or full software inventory.
- To compare one host's build standard with another/many others. While the CIS Benchmark reports built into Change Tracker will assess a host's configuration settings, other configuration/build attributes beyond the scope of the CIS Benchmark may be pertinent, for example:

  - Installed software and updates
  - Open ports
  - Folder/filesystem structure
  - Specified versions of files
  - Service and process lists
  - Other general configuration settings outside of the scope of the CIS Benchmark, e.g., application-specific settings
  - To mine a configuration for specified items, for example, the hash value for a known-bad version of a file.

In all these examples, a full record of the configuration settings for a device is needed to be held at the Gen 7 hub for reuse, and for these instances, the **Send Baseline Events** checkbox should be used in the Configuration Template.

## Send Baseline Events – Setup and Operation

Any tracker can be enabled for the collection of Baseline Events by checking the **Send Baseline Events** box.

![Send Baseline Events Checkbox](https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&ids=0684u00000LdK6Z&d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LzTp%2FUDXXBLgEgGK7leOaYq6Ysnk1LpXg_8WMa8.zD1i100k&asPdf=false)

See below for an example of the **Send Baseline Events** checkbox – this will result in the Installed Software and Updates baseline being pushed back to the Hub as a series of Baseline Events.

The baseline data is sent to the Hub as a series of Baseline Events. These can be viewed directly in the Events screen by selecting Baseline Events.

There are two types of Baseline Event – a Current Baseline and Historical Baseline. When a change is made to the Baseline data, e.g., by adding, changing, or removing a configuration element, the Current Baseline is updated to reflect the change, and a new Historical Baseline event is also created as a record of the previous Baseline for the device.

## Viewing Baseline Records, Tracking Full Configuration Records for Network Devices

For a text output-based Tracker, for example, Network Ports, the Baseline data is the full scan output.

Or for a firewall/router, the Baseline Records allow you to capture a full config record as well as the interim changes made via the Device Events.
