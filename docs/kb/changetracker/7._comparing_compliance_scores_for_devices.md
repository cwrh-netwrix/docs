# Comparing Compliance Scores for Devices

## Overview

The **Compliance** tab provides an overview of compliance scores for all devices within any selected group. The screen shows the previous 7 compliance report results to track any drift against your selected hardened build standard and whether scores are improving or worsening.

Any individual report can be viewed by clicking the result score, and reports selected using the checkboxes can be exported in a range of formats (PDF, Excel, or CSV) with an option to select more detailed results. 

> **NOTE:** Report results will be provided via a link for the Dashboard. This approach is taken so that even for large exports that may take minutes to prepare, there is a structured process for delivering report results.

## Comparing Results

By selecting any two results, either for the same device or for two different devices, the **Compare Results** button becomes available. This will run a comparison of the two reports, which is useful for seeing what has caused a score to drop or to establish what the difference is in configuration between two devices.
