# Getting Started Tutorial

## Overview

Start here! Once you have installed the software using the official download installer from the [Netwrix Members Section (create an account now if you need one)](https://www.newnettechnologies.com/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&Itemid=573&lang=en&view=registers), please follow the instructions in the [Netwrix Change Tracker Gen 7 Server Specification and Pre-Reqs](https://wsww.newnettechnologies.com/index.php?option=com_docman&view=document&layout=default&alias=323-nnt-change-tracker-gen-7-server-specification-and-pre-reqs&category_slug=software-to-download&Itemid=203).

The basis for this Getting Started Guide is that the tutorial uses an Agent and a Hub Server installation on a shared, common server or PC, i.e., install the agent and hub on the same box. The packaged installer will do all of this for you, but please get in touch with support if you need any help at any time.

## First Login

Default login credentials are `admin` / `password`, and you will be prompted to change these after your initial login. As with any system, default settings should be changed to avoid later exploitation of known defaults.

At first login, you will be shown the Gen 7 Dashboard. Full details of the Dashboard functions and features can be found in the Change Tracker Gen 7 Admin Guide. For the purposes of this guide, please select the **Devices** tab.

The local agent installed on the Change Tracker host server will already be running and will have registered with the Change Tracker Hub. The auto-enrollment process is described in more depth later, but depending on server speed, the Local Agent may be found in an ‘Awaiting Registration’ state or already registered in the system. In the example below, the host is registered in both the **All Devices** and **Linux Centos** Groups.
