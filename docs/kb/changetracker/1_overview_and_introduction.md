# Overview and Introduction to NNT Change Tracker Gen 7

## Overview

NNT Change Tracker Gen 7 represents a quantum leap in file integrity monitoring technology, intelligently analyzing events to highlight genuine security incidents.

NNT Change Tracker has been awarded Certified Vendor status by the Center for Internet Security, providing confidence that CIS Benchmark hardening guidelines are always accurately applied to eliminate known vulnerabilities from all common platforms.

But detection of host intrusion and breach activity to combat the threats of spear phishing, contemporary malware, and APT-style attacks also requires forensic visibility of system integrity changes. Providing this level of detection sensitivity also inevitably amplifies the regular background noise generated from system patching and routine application operation.

Until now, getting the best from file integrity monitoring has resulted in products like Tripwire Enterprise needing complicated rules to be configured to minimize change noise and constant manual review of events before accepted changes are 'promoted to the baseline'. Not anymore. Change Tracker Gen 7 re-invents file integrity monitoring, making it easy to use and even more effective for breach detection. The key difference is Closed-Loop Intelligent Change Control (CLICC).

CLICC reconciles the security benefits of forensic change control with the detailed workload necessary to review changes.

The solution is 'Closed-Loop' and 'Intelligent' because any changes made are automatically assessed against expected or permitted changes to the configuration baseline, delivering all the benefits of zero tolerance to unplanned changes and a super-sensitive breach detection capability, but without the time-consuming, resource-intensive (and boring) post-implementation review burden. Planned change blueprints can be recorded from observed system behavior, continually enhancing system intelligence through recognition of regular behavior such as patching changes. By automatically assessing changes, all expected/pre-approved changes such as known patching updates can be isolated, leaving just unplanned changes – potentially breach activity – exposed, to then be properly investigated.

### Key Features

- Approve changes to the authorized baseline with a simple point and click
- All new GUI – contemporary mobile app-style web interface
- All new Hub – Now 100% event-driven, faster, and more scalable to handle large Enterprise deployments, supported on both Windows and Linux
- Auto-Provisioning of monitoring policy and scheduled reporting – workflow of assigning devices to groups, assigning policies, and scheduling regular reports automated – even Enterprise estates are easy to manage
- Integration-Ready for all Service Desk and other 3rd Party Service Delivery management tools – comprehensive REST API provides full two-way integration with change/incident management systems
- New Scheduled Report operation – report on any events for any devices on a one-off or scheduled basis
- CIS Certified Vendor accreditation for a complete range of platform-hardening best-practice guidance
- Pinpoint breach activity in real-time – expected and pre-approved changes are automatically assessed to leave just unplanned, unexpected, and potential security incidents for review
