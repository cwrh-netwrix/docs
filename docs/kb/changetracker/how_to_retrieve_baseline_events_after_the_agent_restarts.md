# How to Retrieve Baseline Events After the Agent Restarts

## Overview

This article explains how to retrieve the baseline events (both the list of files and their hashes) from an agent after it restarts.

## Instructions

Typically, the agent performs a baseline scan of the file system after the agent/server has been restarted. However, to retrieve the baseline events for a server in the Change Tracker dashboard, a couple of settings need to be enabled first. Follow the instructions below to configure Change Tracker for retrieving baseline events:

1. Select the template running against the device and click **Edit**.
2. In the **Editing Tracking Templates** dialog, go to the **FIM File Integrity** tab and enable the **Send baseline events** checkbox.

   > **IMPORTANT:** Enable this option for each of the different trackers depending on which baselines you wish to retrieve.

3. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Agents & Devices**.
4. Select the device and click **Edit**.

Once these options are enabled, baseline events will be sent the next time the agent/server is polled for this data.
