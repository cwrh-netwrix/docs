# How to Apply a Compliance Template to a Group for Automated Reporting in Change Tracker

## Overview

This article will show you step by step how to apply a compliance template to a group in Change Tracker for automated reporting.

> **NOTE:** If you need to upload a template, please view this article: [How to Upload a Compliance Template to Change Tracker](https://kb.netwrix.com/8187).

## Step-by-step Guide

First, determine the template you want and the group of devices you want to apply it to. Here is how it's done:

1. Click on the **Settings** tile.
2. On the left navigation menu, click on the **Groups** tab.
3. From here, select the group to which you want the template to be applied by clicking on it. **Note:** If you attach a template to a mother group, all child objects will also inherit this template.
4. Bring your attention to the right side of the screen, and notice the tabs. Select the **Scheduled Reports** tab.
5. Click on **+Schedule a New Report**.
6. Select your Compliance Report Policy.
7. Define a start and end date. **Note:** Leaving these blank will make the schedule open-ended, and it will run indefinitely.
8. Select the **Schedule** increment in minutes. There are pre-selected options for Hourly, Daily, and Weekly. If these do not suit your needs, enter an interval in minutes.
9. Define the passing score by typing in a percentage. This will have the system provide a pass or fail if the report scores higher or below the defined percentage.
10. Click on the **Update** button.
