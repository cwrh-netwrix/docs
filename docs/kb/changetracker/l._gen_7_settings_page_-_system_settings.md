# Gen 7 Settings Page - System Settings

## Overview

Edit settings such as **SMTP**, **Active Directory**, and **Syslog** server details, and reset the UI to default. The **User Password Settings** enables the enforcement of a User Password Policy where Active Directory is not being used.

After entering **SMTP** and/or **Syslog Host** details, test that emails/messages are being sent correctly by using the **Test** button.
