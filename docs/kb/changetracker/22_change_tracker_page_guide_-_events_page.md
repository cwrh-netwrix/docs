# Events Page

Investigate and review any events for devices using powerful filter controls. Events can be acknowledged and then used to create new Planned Change rules.

- Select a Device Group or All Devices, then check any Devices to view events.
- Click **Filter** to precisely focus on events of interest by time range, attribute/change type, and keywords.
- **Save Filter** can be used to specify events to include in Scheduled Result Queries for users (see **Administration** > **Users** > **Notification Groups**).
- Select events of interest and use **Actions** to acknowledge or create/expand Planned Change definitions, then **Resubmit** to automatically match previous events with the Planned Change ID.

## Using Event Filter

As mentioned previously, the Event Filter is extremely powerful for focusing attention on events of interest, even in large and complex estates with thousands of change/report events to manage. At the top level, a mask can be applied to all screens, not just the Event page, by using the **Device** filter located in the top left-hand corner of the menu banner.

On the Events page itself, devices within the selected Device Group will be available for selection – a free text filter can be used to further mask the devices listed. Note: Multiple devices can be selected to view events from multiple devices.

Once the device(s) of interest have been selected, the Filter Wizard can be used to further focus on time/date range, event, tracker, and change types of interest, including a free text search dimension.

## Saved Filters/Saved Queries – Scheduling Automatic Reports

Once a filter has been defined, it can be saved and given a name and, if required, an automatic schedule for generating regular reports. By default, the user saving the Saved Query will be the recipient for the notification/results email, but additional recipients can be added.

Press **Load Filter** to get a list of all saved filters.
