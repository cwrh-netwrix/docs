# Configuration Templates: Network Port Tracker

## Overview

The Network Port Tracker is designed to detect and track changes to the open network ports on either a single device or a range/group of devices. The tracker uses a network-scanning approach, probing a device externally via the network to determine whether TCP and UDP ports are open or not. The scan is executed from a NNT Gen 7 Agent and utilizes an NMAP instance installed locally to the NNT Gen 7 Proxy Agent.

This means that there are three scanning options available:

- **Self-Scan** - Local Gen 7 Agent scans the local host (Note: for a Windows device, this mode is not available for virtualized Windows machines). The same agent can run a full template including all other tracker types.

- **Remote Scan** – A remote Gen 7 Agent scans the host/device. In this mode, the remote device is configured as a Proxied device for the Agent being used. Therefore, for other trackers to be run against the Proxied Device, credentials will be required (e.g., Cisco Firewall running config can also be tracked if valid credentials are assigned).

- **Network Scan** – A Gen 7 Agent can be used to scan a range of devices. In this instance, the ‘device’ is defined as ‘The Network’ or ‘New York Office LAN’, with the address range defined as ‘192.168.1.1-255’ or ‘192.168.1.18 192.168.1.19 192.168.1.20-100’, i.e., individually specified addresses separated, ranges defined using a `-`.

The NMAP package must be installed to a default program file location (Windows: `Program Files(x86)\Nmap`, Linux: `/usr/bin/`).

The Network Port Tracker is configured by specifying port ranges to include and exclude from the scan. In addition, the protocol used for each range can also be selected, either TCP, UDP, or both.

> **NOTE:** As with any UDP scan, the non-acknowledged nature of UDP requires a more intensive, slower approach which may result in scan times exceeding 24 hours.

## Network Scan Instructions

There are a number of steps required to configure and define a multi-device ‘network’ scan:

1. **Define ‘The Network’ device** – Select the agent from which you would like the scan to run, usually the Agent installed on the Hub server, but any remote Gen 7 Agent or Agents can be used to run scans to their local subnet, thereby simplifying routing/firewall rules.

2. **Schedule the Network Port Tracker** – The Network Port Tracker can then be scheduled to run like any other tracker. However, due to the typically prolonged time needed to complete each scan, especially if UDP ports are included, we advise that the tracker is set to “Polling frequency: run at ‘agent startup’ and repeat ‘No repeat’.”

3. **Initial Poll Completion** – Once the initial poll has completed, the duration will be required as a communications Event.

4. **Baseline Events** – Provided you have specified within the tracker template to ‘Send Baseline Events’, then you will also be able to see both the full baseline/current status for the tracker results, as well as the usual change events. Similarly, you can also report on these, export the events, and receive alerts for any Planned and Unplanned changes.
