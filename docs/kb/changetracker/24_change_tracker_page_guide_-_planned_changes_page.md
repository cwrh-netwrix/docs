# Planned Changes Page

## Overview

Change Tracker's Closed-Loop Intelligent Change Control reconciles the security benefits of forensic change control with the detailed workload necessary to review changes. Changes are automatically assessed against expected changes to the configuration baseline, delivering all the benefits of zero tolerance to unplanned changes and a super-sensitive breach detection capability, but without the time-consuming, resource-intensive post-implementation review burden.

By automatically reducing the background noise of pre-approved changes such as known patching updates, any unplanned changes—which may be breach activity—are exposed and can be investigated. Planned Change definitions can either be recorded from a device in **planned change recording** mode or built from the **Events** page using the **Actions** button. Rules comprising the Planned Change definition are shown using the **Show Rules** button and can be edited using the **Settings** > **Planned Changes** page.
