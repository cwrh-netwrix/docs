# How to Monitor Devices with Ping Adapter (Log Tracker)

## Overview

The Log Tracker Server **Ping Monitor** adapter can be used to continuously issue pings against a list of managed devices and open a ticket (and optionally send an email) if any device does not respond to the ping request within a specified period of time.

After installing the **Ping Monitor** adapter, you can open a single ticket if any device goes offline for a user-defined interval. If properly configured, only one ticket will be opened for the device; no further tickets will be opened unless the device returns to an online state and then goes offline again.

There are several techniques available to do this, but one recommended way is via the **Alerts > Devices** screen. This facility allows the user to apply an alert across a range of devices using a match expression, in this case, the "device is not responding" message generated by the **Ping Polling** adapter.

## Instructions

1. At the Log Tracker Server, go to the **Alerts > Devices** screen and click **Add New**.
2. On the **Add New Device Alert** screen, select the match message to be "device is not responding".
3. On the **Add New Device Alert** screen, set the threshold to be 3 messages and the interval to be 300 seconds.
4. Provide an appropriate alert message and severity.
5. Click **Save** to save the setting.

See the attached screenshot for a typical example of this alert's setup.

The **Test Interval** should be longer than it takes to poll the device 3 timesâ€”300 seconds is adequate for 3 failed poll attempts. Similarly, for 1 failed poll attempt, it can be set to 100 seconds; for 5 failed poll attempts, it can be 500 seconds, etc.

> **NOTE:** If the **Test Interval** above is too small, you will receive multiple tickets (and possibly multiple email messages) when a device goes offline. To fix this, increase the test interval so that once the alert is set, it remains set until the threshold drops, i.e., the device returns online and "device is not responding" stops being sent for the device by the **Ping Poll Adapter**.

See the attached screenshot for additional notes.
