# Gen 7 Settings Page - Agent and Device Administration

## Overview

Devices will be automatically assigned to a Group as determined by the results of the New Device Discovery policy report. Device attributes such as **Group**, **Type**, and **Credentials**, or the option to **Delete Devices**, can be edited below. Use the **Name** box to search and filter devices.

The **Last Poll Time** will also filter devices based on a before or after date/time.

Devices will be automatically assigned to a Device Group based on the Discovery Report - see the [Agent Registration section](https://kb.netwrix.com/8077) for more details on this.

Agent Group assignment can be overridden here.

Each Gen 7 Agent can act as both a direct monitoring agent for its hosting platform and as a proxy agent for running agentless monitoring tasks on remote devices - [See Agentless FIM Proxy Agent Operation](https://kb.netwrix.com/8080).
