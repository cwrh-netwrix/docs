# Events Page

Investigate and review any events for devices using powerful filter controls. Events can be acknowledged and then used to create new Planned Change rules.

- Select a **Device Group** or **All Devices**, then check any **Devices** to view events.

> **TIP:** Make sure the **Device Group** selector, found in the top left-hand corner of the screen, shows **All Devices** and check the **Automatically refresh page** box.

- Click **Filter** to precisely focus on events of interest – specify time range, attribute type, change type, and keywords.
- **Save Filter** can be used to specify events to include in Scheduled Result Queries for users (see **Administration** > **Users** > **Notification Groups**).
- Select events of interest, then use **Actions** to either **Acknowledge** or create/expand a Planned Change definition – use **Resubmit** to then automatically review other previous events for inclusion within the Planned Change ID.

## Event Filter

Jump to the Events screen and make sure the local agent device is checked in the left-hand **Devices** panel. Click the **Filter** button and add **Report** events to the current view and apply this filter.

Provided the device has been registered to a Group, you will see two reports have already been run for the device: the [Discovery Policy report](https://kb.netwrix.com/8077) (see the Admin Guide for full details) is run once a device has been authenticated into the Change Tracker system based on the Agent username and password defined when installing the agent/initial config – see later section for [Agent Installation](https://kb.netwrix.com/8064).
