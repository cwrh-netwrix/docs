## Overview

Please refer to this material to confirm the correct enablement of role services.

> **NOTE:** When installing **Change Tracker Gen 7** on **Windows Server 2008 R2**, some additional steps are required to update the .NET Framework version to 4.5, then enable **IIS Features**, ensuring that **ASP.NET** is an 'allowed' ISAPI extension.

![Change Tracker Agent](https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&ids=0684u00000LdJwd&d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LzPC%2FDoXCSLxI0heI7yxLjRKqWAk4SWACG8kHMX0zBJL6w9Q&asPdf=false)

Once the previous prerequisite conditions have all been met, you can run the installer â€“ make sure that the **Run As Administrator** elevation is used.

The installer will automatically install the main application program, the various database and associated dependencies, and a local **Change Tracker Agent**. The Agent is pre-configured to automatically connect to the localhost and register with the **Change Tracker Gen 7** hub.
