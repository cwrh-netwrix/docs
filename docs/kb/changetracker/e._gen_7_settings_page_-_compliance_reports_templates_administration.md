## Compliance Reports Templates Administration

As a Center for Internet Security (CIS) Certified Vendor, NNT provides configuration audit reports from the acknowledged industry authority in secure configuration guidance, the CIS Benchmarks.

A large number of these are pre-packed with **Change Tracker Gen 7**, but additional templates are always being produced for new or updated platforms.

To import a new template or update an existing one, just upload the template: use the **overwrite** option if updating.
