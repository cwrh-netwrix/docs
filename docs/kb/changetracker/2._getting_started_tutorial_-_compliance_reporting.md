# Getting Started Tutorial - Compliance Reporting

## Overview

To see the full results of the report, click on the device name hyperlink to access the **Device** home page and scroll down to the **Device Report** section. From here, click the **View Report** button for the desired report.

![Device Report Section](https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&ids=0684u00000LdJxw&d=%2Fa%2F4u000000Lzg3%2FyvvnjThe1rS6ZOQIag7YexliTPRSlEm9n.rrf816yG8&asPdf=false)

The report view shows all rules and results. For any rule, the **Result Detail** can be expanded to show the full remediation advice for each rule.

Clicking on the column header will sort report results. For example, to see all **Failed** rules, just click on the **Pass/Fail** header.

Report results can also be exported in either **PDF**, **Excel**, or **CSV** format. The **Template** selector alongside the **Export** button provides options for either summarized pass/fail format or full results details format.

For **Database** and **Agentless Compliance Reports**, please see the section on **Agentless Compliance Reporting** in the **Change Tracker Gen 7 Getting Started Guide**.
