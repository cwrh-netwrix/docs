# Gen 7 Settings Page - Configuration Templates - Process Command Output

## Configuration Templates: Process/Command Output

Where required, Change Tracker can also execute commands on the endpoint device. 

### Agent-Based Monitoring

Where an Agent is being used for monitoring, the commands will be executed directly by the Agent, and the initial baseline will be stored in the local Agent database. Any subsequent changes detected will be reported back to the Hub. The commands will be run using whichever service account has been assigned to it. When run on Windows, any commands are executed from the standard `Windows\System32` shell and therefore may require a full executable path to be specified, e.g.

```plaintext
cmd /C %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd list VDIR /text:VDIR.NAME
```

### Agentless Monitoring

Where agentless monitoring is being used, this works in conjunction with the credentials defined for the device (see Getting Started Guide). The shell delivered by the credentials and logon script will be used. For example, for a Cisco Router, this needs to be the Privilege/Enable prompt.

Commands will be executed indirectly by the Master Proxy Agent being used, and the initial baseline will be stored in the Proxy Agent database. Any subsequent changes detected will be reported back to the Hub. The commands will be run using whichever service account has been used in the assigned credentials.

### Use of Regular Expressions

Whether using agent-based or agentless command output trackers, a Regular Expression can be applied to the command output to filter or match specific keywords or patterns. Note that any device-offered RegEx capabilities, e.g., `egrep` on Linux, can still be used instead of or to complement the Netwrix Agent regex applied.

The Agent will only trust a signed Configuration Template issued from its assigned Hub. Please contact Netwrix Support for more details.
