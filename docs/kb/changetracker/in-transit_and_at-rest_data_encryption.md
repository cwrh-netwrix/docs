# In-Transit and At-Rest Data Encryption

## Questions

1. What transport layer security (TLS) versions are supported for in-transit data encryption in Netwrix Change Tracker?
2. What options are supported for at-rest data encryption in MongoDB in Change Tracker?

## Answers

1. TLS protocol version 1.3 and earlier are supported for in-transit data encryption. It is recommended to disable non-target protocol versions in your environment to ensure the intended TLS version is used.

2. MongoDB Community Edition, which is included in the Change Tracker installation wizard, does not support at-rest data encryption. This feature is available in MongoDB Enterprise only. Learn more in [Encryption At-Rest Â· MongoDB â¸± MongoDB ðŸ¡¥](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-encryption-at-rest/).

   > **IMPORTANT:** Data such as user accounts, passwords, and network device credentials is encrypted using the ASP.NET Core data protection API by default. This type of data is encrypted in both the Community and Enterprise editions of MongoDB.
