# Configuration Templates: Installed Software and Updates

## Overview

Software installations and updates are critical dimensions of a host's configuration. It is therefore essential that these are tracked and recorded from compliance, security, and configuration management perspectives.

## Instructions

Enabling the tracker is simple: check the **Track Installs and Updates** box and then save the settings to the device. Changes will be detected on a scheduled, polled basis, with the frequency governed by the **Repeat** setting. A **No Repeat** setting will ensure a poll only occurs on a server reboot, which may be appropriate for a host with tightly governed resources.

### Windows

A custom tracker is used within the agent to pull and assemble Software and Updates Installation information from the registry.

### Linux Fedora

An appropriate `rpm -q` type command is run on the host.
