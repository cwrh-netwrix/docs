# Alerting - Being Notified of Events

## Overview

Once devices have been assigned to Device Groups and a Configuration Template has been assigned, a Baseline of the configuration will be recorded. Thereafter, any changes detected can be reported as email or syslog alerts.

Each user of the Change Tracker system can be assigned a personalized alerting profile from a range of event options for each Device Group.

## Instructions

Access the User Notification Email page via **Settings** → **User Notification Emails** and select a user, then dial in Notification Types for the selected Device Group.

> **NOTE:** Core system settings such as the Syslog Server and SMTP details will also need to be defined via [Settings → System Settings in the Change Tracker Gen 7 Admin Guide for more details.](https://kb.netwrix.com/8098)
