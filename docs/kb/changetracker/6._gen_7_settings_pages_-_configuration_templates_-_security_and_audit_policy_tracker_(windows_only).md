# Gen 7 Settings Pages - Configuration Templates - Security and Audit Policy Tracker (Windows Only)

## Overview

Change Tracker can be used to track changes to an extended range of Security Settings covered by the Audit and Security Policy.

The majority of critical security settings, user permissions, and audit policy specifications are defined in the Local Security Policy, either directly or via Group Policy.

There is minimal configuration required to activate the tracker â€“ just check the **Track security and audit policy settings in this template** box and define the poll period, then save settings to the Template. Any changes to the initial baseline will be alerted and reported.
