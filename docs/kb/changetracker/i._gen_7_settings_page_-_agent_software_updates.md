# Gen 7 Settings Page - Agent Software Updates

## Overview

If a new Netwrix Change Tracker Agent update is provided, it can be pushed out automatically from the Change Tracker server. The Agent update comprises a new set of program files, plus an `upd` file that signs the update and confirms its integrity.

The deployment schedule for a new update can be controlled via the **Agent Software Updates** tab on a per Device Groups basis â€“ see the Device Groups section earlier.
