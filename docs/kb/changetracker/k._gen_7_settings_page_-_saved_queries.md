# Gen 7 Settings Page - Saved Queries

## Overview

Edit any **Saved Query** defined on the **Events** page and assign a schedule if regular reports are required. **Saved Queries** can be created via the **Events** page using the filter controls to define the event types and scope.

Previously generated query results can be reviewed below. Click on a **Saved Query** name to either define or edit a schedule for the query to be executed.

Scheduled **Saved Query** results can be delivered by email. By default, the username used to create the **Saved Query** will receive the results to their assigned email address. However, it is possible to extend the delivery of **Saved Query** email results to other email addresses by adding these into the **Additional Email Address** field. See the **Users** section earlier for more details on defining usernames and email addresses.

If the **Include Attachment?** checkbox is left unchecked, the **Saved Query** results will be provided via a secure URL within the email body. This is useful to secure report results and also to cut down on potentially large attachments being emailed.
