|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| CPU                                | Quad Core CPU or 4 vCores                        |
| MEMORY                             | 8GB                                             |
| DISK FREE                          | 500GB Minimum*                                   |
| OPERATING SYSTEM â€“ 64BIT ONLY     | CentOS/RHEL/OEL 6.6 64 bit                       |
| MONO FRAMEWORK                     | Version 4.2x (Use either the Platform Manufacturer or NNT repository) |
| WEB SERVER                         | NGINX Version 1.6 (Use NNT Repo/ NNT RPM files) |

*500GB Minimum based on limited trial implementations only. For production, we size based on an average of 4GB per device, per annum, based on typical change event and report volumes (4 Compliance Reports per month, 200 change events per month).  
**(Note: A Redis database is also used for internal records; this will be installed as a dependency for the NNT HubService.)
