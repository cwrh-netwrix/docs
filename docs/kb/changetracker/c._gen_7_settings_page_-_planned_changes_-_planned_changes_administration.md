### Scheduling, Creating and Editing Intelligent Planned Change Rules

Any Planned Change comprises the following elements:

- **Schedule**: Start and End time/date, or continuous/no end date for permanently applied Planned Changes.
- **Scope**: Events from the selected Device Groups will have the defined Planned Change rules applied to them.
- **Rules**: Any number of Rules can be defined for a Planned Change to provide a template for the types of changes to be matched.
- **Rule Definition**: Rules are typically defined against Device Events, with the Tracker, Item Type, and logical operator applied to match a file/registry value/software installation, etc., name/part name.

> **NOTE:** [Rules can also be created directly from an observed event using the Actions button on the Events page](#_Intelligent_Change_Control), or by recording events directly from a device group.
