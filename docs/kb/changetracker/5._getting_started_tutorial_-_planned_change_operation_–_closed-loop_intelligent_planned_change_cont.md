# Getting Started Tutorial - Planned Change Operation – Closed-Loop Intelligent Planned Change Control

## Overview

FIM provides the forensic detail visibility and sensitivity to detect even the stealthiest breach, but this may mean that previously unseen system activity now also becomes highlighted. To manage regular activity such as patching, system upgrades, and normal application operations will all be detected and reported. The beauty of Change Tracker Gen 7 is the range of options and power provided to automatically handle these.

In summary, Change Tracker Gen 7 re-invents file integrity monitoring, making it easy to use and even more effective for breach detection. The key difference is Change Tracker’s Closed-Loop Intelligent Change Control (CLICC).

CLICC reconciles the security benefits of forensic change control with the detailed change review required. The solution is ‘Closed-Loop’ and ‘Intelligent’ because any changes made are automatically assessed against expected or permitted changes to the configuration baseline, delivering all the benefits of zero tolerance to unplanned changes and a super-sensitive breach detection capability, but without the time-consuming, resource-intensive (and boring) post-implementation review burden. Planned change blueprints can be recorded from observed system behavior, continually enhancing system intelligence through recognition of regular behavior such as patching changes.

By automatically assessing changes, all expected/pre-approved changes such as known patching updates can be isolated, leaving just unplanned changes—which may be breach activity—exposed, to then be properly investigated.

## Acknowledging Events

Any unexpected FIM event is potentially a security incident and needs to be investigated. Change Tracker makes this easy—FIM changes are summarized in simple terms. For example, for file system events, the event description is prefixed with either ‘New File’, ‘Changed File’, or ‘Deleted File’.

For more details, just click on the event description for any device event to see the full detail of the change.

Once the event has been reviewed and approved as valid and desirable, the event can be acknowledged and assigned to a planned change.

Select the event(s) to acknowledge, then use the **Actions** button to access the options available.

The default option is to use the **Acknowledge Events under Planned Change** and assign the event(s) to the **Manually Acknowledged Changes** planned change.

The event will now be categorized as a ‘Planned Change’ and therefore will be masked by the filter control for ‘Unplanned’ planned change status. Edit the filter to show planned changes only, and the event will be visible again.

Hovering over the **Planned** link will display the name of the planned change, and clicking on the link will take you to the Planned Changes Page where the events associated with the planned change can be analyzed.
