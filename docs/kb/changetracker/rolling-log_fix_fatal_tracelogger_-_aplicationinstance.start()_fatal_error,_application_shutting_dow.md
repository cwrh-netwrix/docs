# Error: FATAL TraceLogger - ApplicationInstance.Start() Fatal Error, Application Shutting Down

## What Does It Mean?

This error occurs when you have another application using the local agent UI port (6.5 Agent - Port 8095 or Gen7 Agent - Port 8096).

## How Can I Fix This / Should I Worry?

If you are receiving this error, the Netwrix Agent is **NOT** reporting to your hub. This is a critical error, and for monitoring to continue, it must be resolved.

To resolve this error:

1. Check to see if anything is using Port 8095 or 8096.
2. Determine if that port number can be easily changed, or if it cannot.
3. Change the port of that application, or, if it cannot be changed, you can choose to disable the local UI port altogether:
   1. Modify the `NNTAgentService.exe.config` file (`C:\Program Files\NNT Change Tracker Suite\Agent\NNTAgentService.exe.config` or `/opt/nnt/agent/bin/NNTAgentService.exe.config`).
   2. Change the below value to `0` to disable, or assign a new, available port to it.
4. Restart your Netwrix Agent Service.
