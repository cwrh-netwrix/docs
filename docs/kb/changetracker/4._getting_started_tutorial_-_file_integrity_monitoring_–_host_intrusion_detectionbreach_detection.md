# Getting Started Tutorial - File Integrity Monitoring – Host Intrusion Detection/Breach Detection

## Overview

The configuration monitoring policy applied can be exposed by clicking on the **Tracked Items** icon or by clicking through on the **Config Template** name. By default, devices are assigned to a group once they have been registered into the system, and in turn, a configuration monitoring policy will be applied.

![Configuration Monitoring Policy](https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&ids=0684u00000LdJwL&d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LzRF%2FEInM5mzs9DpgJG7fA0oUbBXoSPQFP0gG6bYn8MniCas&asPdf=false)

Making a qualifying change – in this example, adding a new file to `/etc` or editing one of the existing config files held here, such as `/etc/motd` – will be detected and alerted within **Change Tracker**. I created a new file – **FIM_Test** within the `/etc` path using **WinSCP** (or if you are using Windows, any change within a **Program Files** folder or the **Windows\System32**).

![File Change Example](https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&ids=0684u00000LdK8V&d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LzQf%2FkTqfMJub4kKMCdRF.fBUKTGKLI1BYOzK4DZdwPN.6Ps&asPdf=false)

To view **FIM Change Events**, use the **Events** screen: the file change is reported immediately.

> **Tip:** The **Events** screen is designed to handle large enterprise estates with potentially thousands of events; therefore, the filtering and masking of events is crucial. If you don’t see the change event as expected, make sure you have selected the right device and that your filters are not masking the event.

![Events Screen Example](https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&ids=0684u00000LdKCl&d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LzTU%2FZWg59y60Fr4aj651Q3B_e_EeCMOyVz5L4Zp9WDenYH8&asPdf=false)

In this example, the **Device**, **Start Time/Date**, **Tracker Type**, and **Unplanned events only** were selected.

The [Event Filter](https://kb.netwrix.com/8111) is easy to use – just click **Reset Filter** then **Filter** to build a new filter – see **Filters and Scheduled Queries** for more details.

At this stage, the security best practice for handling a **FIM** security incident is to investigate the changes to determine if this is a genuine security breach. Most of the time, changes will be unexpected but not a security breach – **FIM** provides the forensic detail visibility and sensitivity to detect even the stealthiest breach, but this may mean that previously unseen system activity now also becomes highlighted.

Regular activity such as patching, system upgrades, and normal application operations will all be detected and reported, but the beauty of **Change Tracker Gen 7** is the range of options and power provided to automatically handle these.
