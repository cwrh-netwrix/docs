# Intelligent Change Control

## Overview

Change Tracker Gen 7 can operate in a proactive mode, learning to recognize change behaviors associated with approved Planned Change operations.

For example, if our `FIM_Test` change is an approved patching operation that is going to be applied to all other hosts in the estate, instead of just reviewing and acknowledging the change when observed, we could create an Intelligent Planned Change based on the event.

This means that any other matching changes reported would also be automatically acknowledged, provided the changes were reported for approved devices and were within the planned change time window.

In this way, "known-good" changes can automatically be categorized as Planned Changes, while any other changes not matching a Planned Change rule would be flagged as Unplanned Changes. Since the overwhelming majority of changes should be Planned, this greatly enhances the clarity of the breach detection capability of Change Tracker by reducing the "noise" generated by regular, pre-approved changes.

Creating an Intelligent Planned Change is a straightforward "point and click" operation.

1. Select the event or events to include in the Planned Change definition – a separate rule will be created for each event.
2. As previously, use the **Actions** button, but this time, select the **Create a new Planned Change to capture these events** function.

The default Planned Change format includes the "event donor" Device Group only, but other or different groups can be selected. Similarly, the Planned Change window start time is taken from the donor event time and left as an "ongoing" open-ended window, but these can also be edited.

![Planned Change Window](https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&ids=0684u00000LdK2O&d=%2Fa%2F4u000000LzhV%2FB5ownZYv6ZTC61Jn26cifeTXMvlpGGeQgg0TIbp0RVU&asPdf=false)

In this example, just click **Apply**.

Now delete the `FIM_Test` file created previously, then recreate the same file again.

Finally, create a further new file in `/etc` called `Unapproved_FIM_Test`, then refresh the Events page.

![Events Page Refresh](https://nwxcorp--c.na147.content.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7000000091pB&ids=0684u00000LdK8W&d=%2Fa%2F4u000000Lzha%2F7sZVKfC8XkeCTEdh1mEkWOiEjTOtRmW8mVW7n7143FQ&asPdf=false)

Now events are being analyzed automatically, with the Intelligent Planned Change rules being applied to each one as it is recorded.

According to the default ruleset created, `FIM_Test` file operations are now approved, so deletions, additions, and even changes will all be automatically acknowledged as a "known-good" change.

However, other file change operations not matching the rule will still be flagged as Unplanned changes.

The default Planned Change rule created can be seen in more detail by clicking on the **Planned** link, then clicking on the **Show Rules** button. Planned Change rules can be edited and managed via the **[Settings → Planned Changes Administration](https://kb.netwrix.com/8091)** page.
