# Bulk Import Error: SQL Logic Error Unknown Database Strucmap

## Symptom

The 2-FSAA Bulk Import job is returning the following error message:

```text
SQL logic error unknown database strucmap.
```

## Cause

This error message is the result of a discrepancy or corruption in the database's structure map. It can be caused by configuration changes or other interruptions during a scan or database import.

## Resolutions

Please try both of the following resolutions. Start with resetting the hosts, and if the error persists, try [repairing the database](#repair). For both approaches, run the **Bulk Import Maintenance**, targeting the host(s) having the problem.

### Reset the Host(s)

1. Navigate to and select the **2-FSAA Bulk Import** job in the Netwrix Access Analyzer (NEA) Job tree.
   - The exact location in the Job tree can vary based on your deployment.
   - The default location is **Netwrix Access Analyzer (NEA) > Jobs > FileSystem > 0.Collection > 2-FSAA Bulk Import**.
2. Click **Configure > Query > Query properties > Configure**.
   - This opens the File System Access Audit Data Collector Wizard.
3. At the bottom of the wizard, click **Maintenance**.
4. Select the Maintenance type: **_Reset Hosts_**, then click **Next**.
5. Select the hosts that are throwing the error.
6. Click **_Reset Hosts_**.
   - The maintenance should run immediately.
7. After the maintenance run completes, click through the following dialogs: **Continue > Finish > Next**.
8. Ensure that **Import incomplete scan data** is enabled, then click **Finish**.
9. Try running the **FileSystem** collection again.
