# Netwrix Access Analyzer Version Numbers

## Summary
How to find Netwrix Access Analyzer version numbers.

## Issue
When you talk about the version of Netwrix Access Analyzer, you're referring to the core version number.  
This is what you'll find in **Help** > **About**, and it indicates the version of the `StealthAUDIT.exe` file.

The Netwrix Access Analyzer build number refers to the installer package version you'll find in **Add/Remove Programs**.

If you are scanning sensitive data, please also supply the installer package version, which you can find in **Add/Remove Programs**.

## Instructions
