# FSAA Registry Key Error

## Summary
**FSAA Registry Key Error on NAS devices**

## Issue
`Error during processing: Could not open registry key SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SBTLogging\Parameters for reading: Access is denied (5); local: False`

If you get this error after running an FSAA scan, the scan was unable to open a registry key.

## Instructions

### Windows
If you get this after scanning a Windows host, either the registry key doesn't exist or access is denied. To investigate:

1. Open **Regedit**.
2. From **Start**, open **CMD** and run **Regedit** (run it using the same credential as the scan).
3. Navigate to the location in the error message and verify whether the key exists or if you get access denied.

### NAS
If you get this after scanning a NAS host, check the details in Host Management:

1. Open the Netwrix Auditor console.
2. Find **Host Management** on the left-hand side.
3. Select **All Hosts**.
4. Find the host that has the issue.
5. Select **View\Edit Host** (top right).
6. Select **Edit Host** (bottom of the right).
7. Locate the **OSName**, **OSType**, **Model**, and **Manufacturer** fields.
8. Change **OSName** and **OSType** to `NAS`.
9. Change **Model** and **Manufacturer** to `N/A`.
