## Cause

The current user does not have sufficient permissions to the ` %SAInstallDir%` folder. The user must have at least **Modify** permission access to the folder and all child objects.

## Resolution

1. Add the user or group to the security permissions on the ` %SAInstallDir%` folder.
2. Ensure that they have at least **Modify** permission access to the folder and all child objects.
