> **NOTE:** You can create a more uniform and consistent log-in experience across all domains connected to the AIC by leaving it as is and requiring the domain prefix.

## Resolution

> **NOTE:** All domains enabled to access the AIC must also have data collected by the Netwrix Access Analyzer Active Directory Inventory solution as per the following article: Active Directoryâ€”Multiple Domains.
