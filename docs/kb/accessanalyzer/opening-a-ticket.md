# Opening a Ticket

## Overview

This article provides guidance on collecting logs and other relevant information when submitting a support ticket for Netwrix Auditor (NEA).

## Instructions

Follow the steps below to gather the necessary logs and details required for troubleshooting your NEA instance.

### Logs

Follow these steps to gather logs:

- Depending on your current **AIC** version, refer to one of the following default paths:

  - AIC v11.5:

    ```text
    C:\inetpub\wwwroot\StealthAUDIT Compliance\
    ```

  - AIC v11.6:

    ```text
    C:\Program Files\STEALTHbits\Access Information Center
    ```

- Navigate to the following path to collect the **NEA Console logs**:

  ```text
  %SAInstallDir%SADatabase\Logs\Application
  ```

- Gather the **Published Reports logs** from the following path:

  - Locate the **job logs** using the following path:

    ```text

    > %SAInstallDir%\Jobs\GROUP_.Active Directory Inventory\JOB_1-AD_Scan\OUTPUT
    > ```

  - In the **Navigation Pane**, right-click the job and select **Export**. In the new window, specify the components to export and proceed with the export.
