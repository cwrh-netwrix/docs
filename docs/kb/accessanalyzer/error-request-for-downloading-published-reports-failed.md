```

## Cause

The issue is caused by a corrupted `Reports.xml`.

## Resolution

To resolve these errors, follow the steps below.

1. Rebuild the Reports folder under the install path. If you want to back up the folder, archive it prior to deleting the original.

   > **NOTE:** To find the install path, enter the following environmental variable into the application server's Windows File Explorer: ` %sainstalldir%`. Then, right-click the **Reports** folder to archive and/or delete it.

2. Close and reopen the **Access Analyzer** Console to rebuild the folder.

3. To publish the report(s) again, right-click a needed Job Group (for example, **Jobs**), and select **Publish** to publish the reports from the selected job group or job without regenerating the report.
