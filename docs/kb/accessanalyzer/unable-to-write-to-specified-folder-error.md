# Unable to Write to Specified Folder Error

## Symptom

You see the following error when you install or uninstall the FSAA Proxy Scanner or the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on in Netwrix Access Analyzer:

```text
Unable to write to the specified folder: %Folder_path%
```

## Cause

The FSAA permissions module must have write permissions for its installation folder. The write permissions are required to update the Tier 2 data after it is received from the target file server. Once updated, the Tier 2 data is transferred to the SQL backend for reporting.

## Resolutions

1. Confirm that the account running the installer/uninstaller has permissions to write to the ` %SAINSTALLDIR%/FSAA` folder.

   1. Right-click the FSAA folder, navigate to **Properties** > **Security**, and ensure the account has "write" permissions for the folder.
   2. To verify the new write permissions, create a new `.txt` file in the FSAA folder and save it.

2. Confirm the drive containing the FSAA folder is not full.
