# Error When Adding Scheduled Task

## Symptom

When you attempt to save a scheduled task, Netwrix Access Analyzer prompts the following error:

```
Failed to add scheduled job. Error while saving the task. A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated.
```

## Cause

This error occurs because in Local Security Policy settings, the tasks are created with this security option enabled: **Run whether user is logged on or not.**

Within local security policy (`SECPOL.MSC`) | Security Settings | Local Policies | Security Options, this option is enabled: **Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication.**

## Resolution

Disable this setting: **Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication.** If this setting is not configurable, it must be changed at the Group Policy level.
