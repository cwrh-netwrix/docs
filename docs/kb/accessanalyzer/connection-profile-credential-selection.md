# Connection Profile Credential Selection

## Summary
This article explains how Netwrix Access Analyzer selects credentials from Connection Profiles.

Netwrix Access Analyzer tries to match the domain in the **Account** column in the **Connection Profile** to:

1. The Target Host's `WindowsDomain`, as visible in **Host Management**.  
2. The Target Host's `DNSDomain`, as visible in **Host Management** (only if the Target Host's `WindowsDomain` value is blank).

If neither match, Netwrix Access Analyzer will attempt each credential in the Connection Profile in the order listed within the Connection Profile.
