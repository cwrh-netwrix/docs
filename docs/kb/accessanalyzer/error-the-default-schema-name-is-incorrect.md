## Symptom

2. When using the Windows authentication method for the database service account, the account has insufficient permissions to access the database.

## Resolutions

Refer to the corresponding resolution:

1. Log in to Netwrix Access Analyzer (NEA) with a user account that has properly provisioned permissions to the SQL database. Hold **Shift** and right-click the **Netwrix Access Analyzer** icon. Select **Run as different user**.
