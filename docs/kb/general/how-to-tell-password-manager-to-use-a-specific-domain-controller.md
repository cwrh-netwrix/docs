# How to tell Password Manager to use a specific Domain Controller

How to point Password Manager to use a specific Domain Controller for all account operations (password reset, password change etc..)?

## Procedure

1) On the server where the **Password Manager Service** runs, open the **registry** and navigate to `HKLMSoftwareNetwrixPassword Manager` (for 64-bit systems go to `HKLMSoftwareWow6432NodeNetwrixPassword Manager`).

2) Create a new `String Value` named `TargetDC` and specify the **IP address** of the domain controller you want to use.

3) **Restart** the **Password Manager service** after making this registry change to ensure the change is reflected in the next operation.

4) To verify the change is being applied, navigate to the product install directory and find the **ALService** text file. You can then search for the string ` "target_comp" ` occurring at a time AFTER the registry modification was made.
