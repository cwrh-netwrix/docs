# DMZ installation: Portals never load

I installed Password Manager portals on a server in a DMZ and configured as per Administrator's guide, but I cannot get to any portal.  
All 3 of them keep loading and do not show anything.

Such behavior occurs when the frontend server cannot communicate to the backend because of the firewall or antivirus software blocking connection.

## Troubleshooting steps

1. Make sure that the frontend can `ping` the backend and vice versa.
2. Make sure that all required firewall rules are in place. Refer to the KB2145: https://kb.netwrix.com/2145
3. If the above does not help, try temporarily disabling all firewalls and antivirus software to confirm whether they are blocking the connection.
