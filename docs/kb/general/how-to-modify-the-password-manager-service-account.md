1. Run the **Services** snap-in (navigate to **Start** -> **Run** and type `services.msc`).
2. Locate the **Netwrix Password Manager** service.
3. Right-click it and select **Properties**.
4. Navigate to the **Log on** tab.
5. Specify the account you want to use to run the service.
6. Click **OK** and restart the service.
