# Custom Branding in a two server install configuration

When you add a custom logo on the **Branding** tab in the Netwrix Password Reset admin portal, the Self-Service portal does not show this logo.

When the Self-Service portal and the Admin portal are on two different web servers, the image does not exist in the Self-Service portal's web folder.

### Resolution

1. On the computer that hosts the Self-Service portal, navigate to ` %install drive%Program Files(x86)Netwrix Password ManagerWeb_SSImages ` and copy the logo into this folder to replace the existing `logo.gif`.
2. Refresh the Self-Service portal. After refreshing the Self-Service portal, the new logo should show up.
