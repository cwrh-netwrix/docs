# Resolving Issues Where ".ad" Domain Resource Changes are Not Being Saved (IIS Config)

## Overview

This article highlights the procedure for resolving problems where clicking the **Save** button after modifying an Active Directory domain resource results in the **Save** button spinning. In this instance, the frequency of the sync schedule was just saved:

This issue occurs because the ".ad" domain suffix is being filtered by IIS.

## Instructions

1. To remediate this, first open **IIS Manager** (`inetmgr`) on the **Privilege Secure** server.
2. In the left-hand tree, select the **Privilege Secure** server's node. The **file name extensions** tab should be visible.

3. Select the **.ad** extension and in the right-hand pane, select **Remove**.
4. In a command prompt, run `iisreset`. You should now be able to save changes to the configuration on a domain ending in ".ad".
