# Disk Space Occupied by Core.* Files in Gen 7 Agent Servers

## Questions

The `opt/nnt/gen7agent/bin/` directory in Gen 7 Agent servers contains multiple `core.*` files.

1. What are these files?
2. Is it safe to delete these files?

## Answers

1. The `core.*` files located in the `opt/nnt/gen7agent/bin/` directory are core dumps. These core dumps are generated upon a process crash or a fatal errorâ€”they contain a snapshot of the process memory at the time of the crash or error.
2. These core files can be safely deleted to free up disk space.
