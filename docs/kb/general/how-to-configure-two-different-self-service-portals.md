# How to configure two different Self-Service portals

How to create the second instance of Self-Service portal? I have two domains and whant to have a separate portal for each domain.

To create the second instance of Self-Service portal, do the following:

1. In the NetWrix Password Manager installation directory, create a new folder.
2. Copy the entire content of `Web_SS` folder to the new folder.
3. Run Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
4. Create a new virtual directory in the same site, where the **PM** virtual directory is located (by default it is `%ComputerName%/Sites/Default Web Site/PM`).
5. In the **Add Virtual Directory** dialog, populate the **Physical path** field with the new folder full name, for example `C:Program files (x86)Netwrix Password ManagerWeb_SS_2`. Click **OK**.

**NOTE**: In this case all the Branding settings  (logo, support phone/link, prdefined domaine, etc) will be copied too. However changing of these settings via the Administrative portal will only affect the original Self-Service portal.

Refer to the following KB for instructions on hiding domain list and setting predefined domain for portals: https://kb.netwrix.com/2062
