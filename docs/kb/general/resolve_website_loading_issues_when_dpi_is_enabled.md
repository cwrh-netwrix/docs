# Resolve Website Loading Issues When DPI Is Enabled

## Overview

When Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is enabled, the client may block some images, charts, or other elements from loading on websites that are not explicitly blocked. If websites do not load correctly, check whether content delivery networks (CDNs) are being blocked and add them to an allowlist assigned to the relevant Content Aware policy.

- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** A group of geographically distributed servers that speed up the delivery of web content by bringing it closer to users.
- **DPI (Deep Packet Inspection):** An option used by the client to monitor web traffic.

## Instructions

1. In your browser, right-click and select **Inspect**.
2. Go to the **Console** tab and identify which CDN links are being blocked.
3. Add the blocked CDN links to an **Allowlist**.
4. Assign the **Allowlist** to the **Content Aware policy** that you use to block certain websites.
