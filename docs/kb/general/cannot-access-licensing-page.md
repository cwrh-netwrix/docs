# Cannot access Licensing page

An error occurred on the server when processing the URL. Please contact the system administrator.

## Cause

The error occurs because Password Manager service fails to get information about current license form the registry.

## Resolution

To address the issue make sure that the Password Manager service account has Full control on the following:

1. Password Manager installation directory
2. Registry key `HKLMSoftware[Wow6432Node]NetwrixPassword Manager (Wow6432Node only for x64 OS)`

Even if the service account is a member of local Administrators group, please try to grant Full control to the service account explicitly.
Restart the Netwrix Password Manager service after granting permissions.
