  User statuses on the Helpdesk portal may flip between Not locked and Not found
  after each refresh. This happens when an LDAP query to Active Directory
  returns no matching users, often due to an incorrect domain entry; the article
  explains how to verify and correct the domain.

## Cause
Password Manager refreshes users' statuses every 30 seconds. Such behaviour could occur if an LDAP request to AD returns that there are no users with such names.

It could be related to an invalid domain name.

## Resolution
1. Go to Administrative portals - **Domains**
2. Click **Edit** the corresponding domain
3. Make sure domain name is correct and is entered in `UPPERCASE`
4. Click **OK** to save changes
