# Directory Name Is Invalid Error

## Symptom

Netwrix Data Classification prompts the following error:

```text
Component: conceptCollector
Level: Error
FileSystemConfigManager.Refresh()
Error refreshing source %share_path%: The directory name %share_path% is invalid.
```

## Cause

A file share is unavailable.

- The affected share does not exist or was removed. The source is still added in Netwrix Data Classification.
- The Netwrix Data Classification service account does not have permissions to access the source.

## Resolutions

- Review the path and verify the share is still available. If the affected share is not available, delete the source to stop the error.
- Review the path and verify the Netwrix Data Classification service account has Full Control permissions to access the shared folder.
