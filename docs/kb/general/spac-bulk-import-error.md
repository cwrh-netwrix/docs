# SPAC Bulk Import Error

## Issue

SPAC Bulk Import is prompting the below error:

```text
ERROR  SHAREPOINTACCESS  Netwrix.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute  "[C:8] Unable to perform bulk import Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK_SA_SPAC_GroupMembershipChanges_HOST_ID". The conflict occurred in database "Access Analyzer", table "dbo.SA_SPAC_ActivityEvents". The statement has been terminated."  POINT32HEALTH.SHAREPOINT.COM  DCExtract  8640  6516  6284
```

## Cause

The SPAC Bulk Import was unable to be completed due to a foreign key constraint merge between the SP_SPAC_GroupMembershipChanges table and the SA_SPAC_ActiviyEvents table. 

## Resolution

We removed all SPAA and SPAC tables since there's a 180-day retention period on SP activity. Once all tables were removed from the database we then reran the SPSEEK jobs and verified that the tables were repopulated on the database. We suggest allowing these scans to run and monitor the SPAC bulk import job. After monitoring the job it was confirmed that the SPAC Bulk Import job was successful.
