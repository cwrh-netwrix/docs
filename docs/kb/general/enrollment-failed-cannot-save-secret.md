# Enrollment failed: cannot save secret

When enrolling a user, the following error occurs:

`Enrollment failed: cannot save secret`

## Cause

Netwrix Password Secure is trying to create a `secrets.bin` file in the Netwrix Password Secure installation directory. The account used for the Netwrix Password Secure service does not have proper write access to the Netwrix Password Secure installation directory.

## Resolution

1. Provide the Netwrix Password Secure service account rights with `Modify` and/or `Write` to the Netwrix Password Secure installation directory.
2. Verify that the account is a domain admin and a local administrator on the Netwrix server where Netwrix Password Secure is installed.
3. Verify the Administrators group on the Netwrix server has `Modify`/`Write` access to the Netwrix Password Secure installation directory.
