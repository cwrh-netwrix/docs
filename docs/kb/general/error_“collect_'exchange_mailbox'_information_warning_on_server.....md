## Symptom

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service is running on the target OWA Server.
2. If the issue persists, exclude the required OWA Server from data collection by modifying the file called **omitserverlist_ecr.txt**.
3. The configuration file is stored in the **%Product installation folder%\Active Directory Auditing**.
4. Add one OWA Server name per line, for example:
   - OWA-SERVER01
   - OWA-SERVER02
