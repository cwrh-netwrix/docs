# Source Code Is Not Detected

## Question

Why is source code not detected?

## Answer

Source code detection may be less effective when only a small volume of code is present in a file.

As described in the user manual, source code detection can encounter challenges with small code snippets. This is often due to potential overlap among various programming languages. Consider these limitations when configuring and using source code detection for optimal results.

The detection rate is directly proportional to the number of code lines in a file. Shorter files with less code are less likely to be detected correctly.
