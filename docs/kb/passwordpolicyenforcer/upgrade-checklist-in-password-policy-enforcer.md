# Upgrade Checklist in Password Policy Enforcer

## Overview

This article covers steps to take when upgrading Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer (PPE) in your environment.

## Instructions

Refer to the following steps to complete the PPE upgrade:

1. After you upgrade the **PPE Server** installation in one domain controller (DC), select **No** when a reboot is prompted.
