# Using Item-Level Targeting with Policies and Collections

Item-Level Targeting is used in Microsoft Group Policy Preferences and other areas of Netwrix
Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) to target or filter where specific items will apply.
With Endpoint Policy Manager Software Package Manager, Item-Level Targeting can be placed on
collections, as well as policies within collections. To do this, select Add > New Collection.

A collection enables you to group together Endpoint Policy Manager Software Package Manager policies
so they can act together. For instance, you might create a collection for only East Sales users, and
another for HR Users.

Below you can see the two collections we have created. These collections can hold other collections
or policies. Next we will apply Item-Level Targeting for a collection.

To change the Item-Level Targeting, right-click any Endpoint Policy Manager Software Package Manager
policy, and select **Edit Item Level Targeting**.

The Edit Item Level Targeting menu item brings up the Targeting Editor. You can select any
combination of characteristics you want to test for. Administrators familiar with Group Policy
Preferences' Item-Level Targeting will be at home in this interface, as it is functionally
equivalent.

You can apply one or more targeting items to a policy, which enables targeting items to be joined
logically. You can also add targeting collections, which group together targeting items in much the
same way parentheses are used in an equation. In this way, you can create a complex determination
about where a policy will be applied. Collections may be set to And, Or, Is, or Is Not.

When targeting policies and collections for Endpoint Policy Manager Software Package Manager, it is
a good idea to target portable computers and mobile user security groups. You can also require that
users not be on the corporate LAN.

In this example, the Pak would only apply to Windows 10 machines when the machine is portable and
not on the corporate LAN subnet, and the user is in the FABRIKAM\Traveling Sales Users group.
