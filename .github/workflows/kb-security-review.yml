            **SECURITY REVIEW: Knowledge Base Customer Data Leakage Detection**

            You are performing a security review of documentation changes to detect potential customer data leakage.

            ## Your Task

            1. Use `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to get all changes in this PR
            2. Focus ONLY on changes to files in `docs/kb/` directory
            3. Analyze the diff for potential customer-identifying, environment-specific, or proprietary information

            ## What to Flag

            Identify and flag ANY of the following types of sensitive data in the ADDED lines (+):

            ### High Priority - Customer Infrastructure
            - **Hostnames, FQDNs, or domains** that are NOT:
              - Netwrix domains (netwrix.com, stealthbits.com, anixis.com)
              - Microsoft/vendor domains (microsoft.com, azure.com, office365.com, github.com, etc.)
              - Generic documentation examples (example.com, contoso.com, fabrikam.com, northwind.com)
            - **IP addresses** that appear to be real customer infrastructure (not obviously generic like 192.0.2.x)
            - **MAC addresses**
            - **Server names or computer names** that look customer-specific (not generic like "server1", "dc01")

            ### High Priority - Identifiable Information
            - **Email addresses** that are NOT:
              - Netwrix employees (@netwrix.com)
              - Generic examples (user@example.com, admin@contoso.com)
            - **Usernames or account names** that appear customer-specific (not generic like "testuser", "john.doe")
            - **Company or organization names** that are NOT part of Netwrix products/brands
            - **Customer-specific Active Directory structures** (OU paths with non-generic naming)

            ### Medium Priority - System Details
            - **File paths** that reference real customer systems or contain customer-specific naming
            - **URLs** pointing to customer infrastructure
            - **Registry keys** with customer-specific values or paths
            - **Database names** or connection strings with customer-specific information

            ### Medium Priority - Credentials & Keys
            - **License keys, serial numbers, or activation codes**
            - **API tokens, access tokens, or credentials**
            - **GUIDs or UUIDs** that appear in security contexts (credential IDs, API keys)
            - **SSH fingerprints or cryptographic keys**
            - **Certificate thumbprints or serial numbers** from real certificates

            ### Medium Priority - Log Output
            - **Log snippets or error messages** containing:
              - Customer hostnames, domains, or IP addresses
              - Customer usernames or email addresses
              - Customer-specific paths or identifiers
              - Real timestamps that could identify customer activity patterns

            ## What NOT to Flag (False Positives)

            - Netwrix product domains and infrastructure
            - Microsoft example domains (contoso.com, fabrikam.com, northwind.com, tailspintoys.com)
            - Generic placeholders like "example.com", "domain.com", "company.com"
            - RFC 5737 documentation IP addresses (192.0.2.x, 198.51.100.x, 203.0.113.x)
            - Generic server names (server1, dc01, web-server, etc.)
            - Generic usernames (admin, testuser, john.doe, jane.smith)
            - Placeholder GUIDs in obvious example contexts
            - localhost, 127.0.0.1, or other loopback addresses
            - Private IP ranges in obviously generic examples (10.0.0.1, 192.168.1.1)

            ## Output Format

            If you find ANY potential customer data leakage:

            1. Use `gh pr comment` to post a review comment with the following structure:

            ```markdown
            ## ⚠️ KB Security Review: Potential Customer Data Leakage Detected

            This PR contains changes to Knowledge Base files that may include customer-identifying or environment-specific information that should be reviewed and potentially redacted.

            ### Findings

            ---

            ### Review Checklist

            Before merging this PR, please verify:
            - [ ] All hostnames and domains are either Netwrix-owned, well-known vendors, or generic examples
            - [ ] No customer-specific email addresses or usernames are present
            - [ ] IP addresses are either RFC 5737 documentation IPs or clearly generic examples
            - [ ] File paths and URLs do not reference real customer systems
            - [ ] Log snippets have been sanitized of customer-identifying information
            - [ ] No license keys, tokens, or credentials are exposed

            ### Need Help?

            - Replace customer domains with: `example.com`, `contoso.com`, `fabrikam.com`
            - Replace customer IPs with: `192.0.2.1`, `198.51.100.1`, `203.0.113.1`
            - Replace customer servers with: `server01`, `dc01`, `web-server01`
            - Replace customer accounts with: `testuser`, `serviceaccount`, `domain\admin`
            - Replace GUIDs with: `<credential-id>`, `<guid>`, or obviously fake ones
            ```

            2. Keep findings GENERAL and ACTIONABLE - never quote the actual sensitive data in your review
            3. Focus on WHAT needs review, not on explaining WHY the data is sensitive
            4. Group findings by file for clarity
            5. Provide specific line numbers or sections to review

            If NO customer data leakage is found:

            1. Use `gh pr comment` to post:

            ```markdown
            ## ✅ KB Security Review: No Customer Data Leakage Detected

            This PR has been reviewed for potential customer data leakage in Knowledge Base files. No customer-identifying, environment-specific, or proprietary information was detected in the changes.

            The documentation changes appear to use appropriate generic examples and do not expose customer infrastructure or identifiable information.
            ```

            ## Important Guidelines

            - Be thorough but practical - focus on real risks, not theoretical ones
            - Prioritize HIGH and MEDIUM severity findings
            - When in doubt about whether something is customer-specific, FLAG IT for human review
            - Provide actionable guidance, not just identification
            - Keep the tone professional and helpful, not accusatory
            - Remember: The goal is to protect customer privacy and maintain documentation quality

            Now perform the security review and post your findings.
